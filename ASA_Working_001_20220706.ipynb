        "Coding allows us to see themes and patterns in qualitative data, but it can also get repetitive and dreary, especially with codes that are rather informational than interpretative. \n",
        "\n",
        "Previous approaches to automating qualitative coding rely heavily on prespecified rules, statistical assumptions, or dictionaries of keywords, often at the price of interpretative adaptability. \n",
        "\n",
        "Recent developments in deep learning models of natural languages provide a promising opportunity for qualitative researchers to scale their coding without compromising adaptability. Instead of following prespecified rules, deep learning algorithms are designed to mimic human behavior using human-generated examples. \n",
        "\n",
        "After iteratively establishing a codebook and some learning examples by hand-coding a sample of qualitative data, deep learning can help researchers quickly scale their initial codings on the remaining data and save up time and energy for thinking deeply about the data and the code. \n",
        "\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook walks you through the deep-learning-powered workflow we developed in our own study for analyzing in-depth interview data. "
