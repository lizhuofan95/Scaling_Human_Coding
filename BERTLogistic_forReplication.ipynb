But if I was going to go in for surgery and, you know, put my life in someone’s hands, I want them to have seen it before, done it before, and that’s why they were recommending I go somewhere that has seen it and done it, not necessarily that there isn’t anybody that could’ve have done it, but not that they would recommend.  His recommendation was M. D. Anderson because he had dealt with them before on different cases, so that was one of them that he recommended and that’s basically where I ended up at anyway.  A lot of Internet research, looking up different terms and what they meant, just basically looked up what it was and then as far as doctors’ reviews, you know, obviously we started out with a general search, you know, cancer, and then we would read about who was in the field and who has done what, who’s G.I. area, you know, talked about this type of cancer and what they’ve done for it.

So that’s what I ultimately chose to do.  You know, and it’s all, you know, I guess the decision I made or whatever, but trying chemo first and it not shrinking, it was close to a main blood vessel so had it grown, then they couldn't have operated.  So to me it was an easy decision to make.  So that being said, that being out, there’s still, in my abdominal and the fatty tissue areas, there’s still, you know, cancer there.  But as far as the prognosis goes, it’s much better now that it’s away from the vein and I don’t have to worry about that immediate issue.  I guess there are two, two different views.  If the chemo works, then life’s probably going to be good for me.  If it doesn't work, then it’s just how do we extend it.  So at this point I really don’t know what the real answer is.  The hope is that the chemo works.\",\n",

They were booked up or whatever, and I went ahead – I [..?..] like three days here, but we sped up the follow-up appointment which I met you at, at that time.  Didn't realize there was going to be a follow-up appointment but had to set that one up.  Went back to Jacksonville and got a port-o-cast put in, anticipating starting chemo, because M. D. Anderson, I was trying to see them – I don’t remember what the date was but it was like a Thursday, and the woman I was talking with on the phone said they couldn't get the appointment in.  It was like it would be like another week or so.  And I told her, I said, “Hey, here’s the deal.  You know, I’ve already got a game plan from U.C. San Diego.  Either get me in or that’s what I’m going with.”\",\n",

The plan, as it was at that point, was to start chemo, shrink it and then do the surgery and then do what they call a high peck(?) type of chemo, which is heated tubes in your abdomen or whatever.  That was the plan at that point.  They didn't want to do the surgery first.  So that was basically what I was going to go with.  M. D. Anderson got me in the first week in March, the 7th to the 10th or 11th, got me in, ran all their tests and then said no, they want to do surgery first, which is what I really wanted to do.  I wanted to get it out.\",\n",

You know, they were assuring me that they would do the surgery at a later point anyway, that they thought there was enough margin to do that.  But again, I really didn't want to take the chance.

So therefore, you know, I was looking at it from the aspect that if we can get it out, even if they don’t get it all, you know, get the main threat out, then I’m better off.  And the different doctors and the different hospitals have their views on how to do it.  You know, I’m not saying anybody’s right or wrong, but for me, it was get rid of it and then deal with what’s left over later.\",\n",

So I basically got sick.  They put the tube back in.  I was puking up green, nasty stuff so yeah, it wasn't a pleasant experience.  The physical, I guess, attributes obviously aren’t good.  Just the feeling weak, not being, you know, able to do – you know, the muscles were cut obviously but just you know, up until a couple days ago really I would get like bloated and look like I was pregnant and had gas and pain.

       " 'Yeah, just give me like clues, okay?',\n",
       " \"But I could go into it.  Okay.  So I, for the last 25 years, I’m a trained(?) musician, [..?..] composer, which is kind of feast or famine.  But needless to say, I had not had health insurance.  All healthcare I’d gone through the emergency room.  I’ve had emergency surgeries, and I have horrible credit because of it 'cause they send me bills which I can never pay.  So San Francisco got Healthy San Francisco, which is [..?..] universal healthcare, which you’re probably familiar with, which for the first time I had a primary care physician, saved my life 'cause otherwise I would not [..?..] and I found out at the last possible moment diagnosis.  So it covered everything.  I had surgery in January.  After that Healthy San Francisco quickly dropped me because --  Well they didn't really drop me.  It’s good for what it was but it’s, they’re not prepared to absorb like the cost of chemotherapy and stuff, which is like mind-boggling expensive.  So they facilitated a transfer to Medi-Cal.  So once I had Medi-Cal my options were opened up and so, you know --  I mean, I was, from the beginning was doing all kinds of research and being made aware.  Pretty quickly saw that UCSF was number seven in the country for cancer survival, so obviously why would I not want to go to the best possible hospital I can here in town?  So I called them.  I said, you know, “Do you guys take Medi-Cal?”  And they’re like yes.  And I said, “Great.  Can I get a referral to an oncologist?”  And it was actually great(?).  I’ve got to tell you, after all my experience navigating the healthcare stuff, even General, everything’s a pain in the butt.  I mean, even like with Healthy San Francisco.  And I mean, it is what it is and it’s great.  But it was just like, it was a pain in the butt.  When I went in for surgery they were suddenly telling me, “Oh, well you haven't” --  Anyway, the point, what I’m getting at, as soon as my first phone call to UCSF, and, you know, nobody’s paying me to say it; I’m just telling you, I was like impressed with like how easy it was to navigate to get who I needed on the phone.  By the time I got off the phone they had emailed me a new patient packet with a new patient number.  I was like wow.  And then within a couple days I had an appointment with Dr. Kelly for a second opinion and with instructions I needed to get, prepare for and all that stuff.  That’s basically how I wound up – and I was pretty psyched, you know, pretty happy and --  That’s it.  That’s the answer to that question.\",\n",
       " '‘Cause you’ll probably say --  I realized the next thing I was going to say was probably going to be the answer to another question so I can stop there.',\n",
       " \"The Internet.  I mean, from the beginning I’ve done exhaustive research about every aspect of, you know, just my disease and the treatments.  And I wanted to know, you know, where’s the best --  ‘Cause actually, to be honest, what kind of got me thinking about, you know, these Cancer Centers of America, you know, they have these commercials which really just like, you know, they play to your emotions.  But I’m also – anything that’s advertised on TV, like colleges, you know, [..?..] College, like you go look on it, it’s all bad, you know.  So I was just like okay.  But, you know, I’m on Cancer Centers of America.  They say that this is --  So as soon as I did a search on it it was like class action lawsuits and all this kind of stuff, which didn't surprise me.  So I thought well okay, Cancer Centers of America are not the best place to go.  What is?  So it’s pretty easy.  U.S. News, World Report, quick stuff, quick, like it immediately comes up.  And so, I mean, I could tell you right now the top ten, you know.  I memorized it.  I know which ones that fluctuated so I’m pretty on top of that.  I mean, I’m kind of very keenly aware of that.  And so from the get-go I knew that – that’s where I found that out and I read a lot about UCSF and so, yeah.\",\n",
       " \"Well on the Internet, on --  There’s all kinds of information on the Internet about it, obviously, and so that’s what --  I mean, there were others I read but that was the main one I remember that I found.  It was U.S. News and World Report, and ranked hospitals in every category, you know.  They would focus on the top ten so like M.D. Anderson being number one, Stone Kettering(?), two, and UCSF is seven.  And so I’m in San Francisco so why wouldn't I want to, you know --\",\n",
       " \"At that point?  Well actually, at that same time, 'cause part of my whole [..?..] process is weighing a decision to relocate, which has kind of been a huge --  ‘Cause I’m not happy in San Francisco.  I want to get out of San Francisco.  Only thing that’s keeping me here, actually at this point, is to be treated, to explore treatment with Dr. Katie(?) Kelly.  Otherwise I’d be out of here.  I live alone in the Tenderloin in an SRO and it’s just a miserable environment.  I want to relocated.  I want to move someplace where I can live with family and friends.  I mean, I have options right now.  And so anyway, one of those options from the beginning or two or three of the big ones were to go to L.A., where I have long time friends and family, and so I was looking at UCLA also 'cause they’re number ten [..?..] Ronald Reagan.  So I was doing the same thing.  I was looking at that, I was looking at UCSF and I was trying to find out and looking at – you know, my home is, where I’m from is Dallas, so I was looking at that but finding out that like it’s almost impossible --  Most states you can get Medicaid and transfer but Texas is like, from my research, the most difficult state of all so I kind of ruled that out.  And then the other option was Denver, 'cause I have close life-long friends there that I can go live with in a house outside of, you know, out of the city with like a bathroom and – I mean, just like I can live in a family home environment as opposed to in the Tenderloin.  So I’m trying to weigh --  That’s kind of a big part of my decision-making, is trying to weigh --  So yeah, so I was looking at -- that kind of was all what I was looking at at the same time.  And since I’m in San Francisco – and they immediately facilitated an appointment and stuff, so that’s where I went for now, you know.\",\n",
       " 'With my diagnosis?',\n",
       " \"Well, you know, I kind of just knew something was wrong but I was kind of like --  Okay, so I got Healthy San Francisco.  It was about a year ago, actually January, around January/February of 2010 when I first – and I’ve got a PCP and began to go to appointments.  And I hadn't had a doctor for so long I had this list of like, you know, everything I was sure was breaking down.  And so we were doing tests and I was finding out that I was actually in great health.  I mean, it was like every test came out like – and especially, you know, I’m kind of in the wake of coming out of like a decade of a substance abuse problem, which was really kind of --  And it wasn't like a little problem.  It was a big problem, you know.  It kind of had a profound, negative impact on my life and my career and my family.  I mean, we all sort of know that, either through personal experience or through TV and film, I mean, I think we all have a sense of like the profound toll and negative impact it can have on a person’s life and relationships and finances and career and all.  So I was finding out that everything was --  And I had this great doctor.  I loved her.  And she was actually, really encouraged me to kind of – she actually was kind of an advocate, without being pushy, an advocate for me getting clean.  So how did I find out?  So the last thing that I wasn't dealing with was some problems in my GI tract, you know, just kind of --  And, you know, but that was the last thing you want to talk about, and she actually gave me a test kit to take home, fecal occult(?) blood kit, which I didn't deal with.  I just kind of like ignored it.  It was easy being, when using drugs and stuff, it’s kind of easy not to deal with things so I kind of didn't really do it.  And then, but problems got worse and so in September of last year I got clean and I’ve been clean since.  And so pretty quickly after getting clean you start dealing with things.  And even though I had all these tests and everything was coming back, I’m in great health, I just became – like something is definitely not right, you know, in areas(?) like this.  And so I talked to my doctor again and she’s like, “Well you never brought the test,” and it’s still sitting in my cabinet.  [..?..]  It’s kind of like hello?  So finally I did it and I took it in and that was in October and they actually had me wait.  They said, “We’re just going to do this test right now.”  And the lab tech came out and said – at the clinic I go to – she came out and said, “You need to schedule as soon as possible to have more tests.”  And I was like – and by this time, I’ve got to tell you, by this time I’d already self-diagnosed because – I know they say don’t do that – but with all my symptoms.  Because it was a growing concern.  And once they said that --  I was already becoming suspicious 'cause I was like all, every symptom, I was like it could be this or it could be this or it could be this.  But there’s also, one thing that had come up in tests was I had a high platelet count, which would indicate infection or HIV or Hep C or something, which all those things are negative.  So it was just kind of a curious thing, like why are your platelets high?  And so I [..?..] possible thing it could be.  It could be cancer.  So now with all these symptoms and this test coming back saying, you know, you need to have more tests and this high platelet count, I kind of said --  I went to my doctor.  I said, “Look, I think I have cancer.”  She’s like, “Probably not.  You know, with your age.”  She said, “But we’ll schedule a coloscopy[sic].  Now here’s what’s good and bad about universal healthcare.  You know, it’s great that I had a doctor to do tests.  She says, “But we’ll put you on a waiting list.  Take like six months.”  And everything I’m reading, [..?..], no, no, no.  She says, “Well we have to draw some more blood.  If you’re anemic in any way or there’s anything we find with your – we can maybe get the test in two to four months.”  And I had major anxiety.  It was two to four months.  This was in October, the end of October, beginning of November. \",\n",
       " \"2010.  It was just, you know, the past fall.  So she was also – you know, I love my doctor, Dr. Zaroni(?).  But she said, “God, it’s really a drag too because it’s my last day at the clinic,” and which kind of like devastated me 'cause I just had like – I really just thought highly of her and I really was comfortable with her.  I’d been seeing her for a year.  It really kind of broke my heart, not broke my heart but I was so --  It was the last day of her clinic.  She was leaving to take a research position somewhere and I was just like oh, my God.  “Well who’s going to be my doctor?”  “I don't know yet.  Somebody will be assigned to you.”  And so they wouldn't even have the results of these blood tests by January.  I was just like oh, my God, like this is – 'cause now I’m convinced I have cancer.  It’s like, “Don’t worry.  You’re probably okay, you know.  It’s probably something else but we’ll put you on a waiting list.”  Two days later I had an appointment slip in the mail for General Hospital, Ward 3, and I was like, on one hand I was thrilled I was like seeing a doctor.  It was like for a week later.  And on the other hand I was like what did they find in the blood tests that moved me from six months to like, you know, a week?  So I get to the appointment early with bells on, you know, and I’m just like – you know, all these questions and everything.  And this intern comes in and she says, “Okay, so let’s take a look at this hernia.”  I’m like, “Hernia?”  And so I had completely forgotten, like when I first got my doctor back in January, she was determined I had a very small, insignificant hernia and put me on a waiting list to be seen about that.  So this was like nine months later, I was finally being given my appointment but it didn't say it on the appointment.  So I was just like, “You know what, forget the hernia.”  I’m sitting here like, you know, at General.  I was like, “Can I tell you what’s really going on?”  So I told her and so then the attending came in.  She took all the information down, and the attending comes in, this guy Dr. Schechter(?).  I’ll never forget him.  He’s like great, just like --  You know, he came in and he said to the internist, “Let me teach you something about how the healthcare system works.”  And you’re the intern.  He says, “It’s like a football game and the patient’s the football and you’ve got the football end zone, with end zones where the patient needs to be, and there’s all kinds of people out there blocking, their job is to work very, very, very hard to make sure that you don’t get the patient to the end zone.”  And said, “There’s a whole bureaucracy.  So what you have to do is you have to take it, you can’t throw it, you can’t hand it off, you’ve got to take the patient personally” --  And so he took me and led me down the hallway to radiology and he goes, “This gentleman needs an appointment for a col(?) to be next Tuesday.”  I was looking at this guy going oh, my God, thank you, you know.  So then the woman behind the counter is going like blah, blah, blah, you know.  And he turns to the intern and goes, “See, you’re on the one-yard line and they’re still trying to keep you from getting in the end zone.”  He goes, “No, this gentleman needs a col(?) to be next Tuesday.”  And he goes, “And you stand there until we get the patient what they need.”  And so once she had scheduled the col(?) on Tuesday, he turns and he says, “Okay, look.  I’ve got to go, get back to work.  But good luck, you know.  Let’s make sure nothing exciting’s(?) going on down there and then we’ll check this hernia out.”  So like I watched him walk away and was going oh, my God.  Like I’ll never forget him.  He definitely saved my life because as it turns out got the colonoscopy the following Tuesday and they, you know, I left the hospital with this thing saying “you have a large malignant tumor in your colon,” which I already knew.  And by this time I’m just like, I’m just waiting for everybody to catch up with me.  And like they’re saying “don’t self-diagnose” and I understand the purpose, but I feel like I’m smart enough to balance like, you know, a healthy amount of hypochondriac with relevant information.  And so you just have a sense of these things.  So I was like okay, now what.  So within a few days I was meeting with the surgeon to schedule a surgery for a colonoscopy.  That’s how fast(?).  So then they scheduled a CT scan for staging.  The doctor said he thought it was probably going to be, they’d probably find stage II.  At that point I was still like okay, we’ve got this under, you know, I think we found this in good time.  As it turns out, the scans, you know, I had a CT scan a few days later, which came back that it had, there were numerous lesions, malignant lesions, you know, metastatic lesions on my liver, you know.  And I was just like, you know, what do you do with that?  So anyway, it obviously means stage IV and kind of a --  Yeah, so that’s how I found out.  That was, you know…\",\n",
       " 'Oh, yes.  Yes.',\n",
       " \"I mean, I love sort of doing research and learning new --  You know, I don't know what people did before the Internet.  But like if I have a question, it goes through my head, I’ve kind of trained myself.  I mean, it could be anything.  I just like, instead of asking, if I wonder about something, I just go okay, let’s find out.  So in this particular case I’m like I’m not sitting around waiting.  I was reading everything I could find.  I kind of knew already, you know, I’d already decided, prepared myself, I just was pretty, like 99% sure I had colon cancer by this time.  So then once I knew for sure, I was definitely reading everything about it.  And another thing I knew too was like, you know, survival rates for stage 0 are like 93 or 87%, in stage I it drops off.  No, I think stage I is actually 87% and stage II drops off to 63% and stage III is like 47% and then like stage IV drops off to 8%.  And everything I would read about like treatments, I mean, everything’s --  Like stage I, II, II and stage IV, they wouldn't say anything.  They were just like stage IV.  I mean, everybody’s referring me to everything from holistic to herbal supplements to treatments, you know, mainstream websites and obscure websites.  I mean, I was reading everything and everything was like stage I, II, III.  And stage IV, they were just like [..?..], you know.  So finding out I was stage IV was obviously pretty dismaying, you know.  I was like holy sh__, you know.  Because also I felt like I was getting my life back on track, all my dreams.  I was happier and healthier than I’d been in ten years, you know.  And then all of a sudden psych, you know.  But anyway, so…\",\n",
       " \"They told me it’s very aggressive.  The largest tumor doubled in size from --  For CT scans, the largest tumor on my liver was 3.5 centimeters.  By the second time they did scans it was, it had doubled in size to 6, 6 centimeters.  My CEA in December --  I don't know if you’re aware of CEA.\",\n",
       " \"CEA is, it’s their marker for colon cancer.  It’s carcinogenic embryonic anlagen(?), [..?..] anlagen they find in the blood, and basically they use it as a marker to track the progress of the disease.  A normal – yours is probably somewhere between, if you’re a non-smoker, it’s probably 2.5.  Smokers might be as high as between 2.5 and 5.  That’s normal.  So mine was 7.5 upon diagnosis.  By the time I had surgery it was, or after surgery, the next time they checked it, it was up to 30.  By April, like the largest tumor had reached 6.6 centimeters, it peaked at 79.  So you can see I was --  And so they said this is very aggressive.  But on the flip side of it, well this is what my surgeon said.  My surgeon told me, he said --  I loved my surgeon.  He was awesome.  He teaches here at UCSF, Dr. Jim(?) Horn(?).  He teaches the surgery that he did, laparoscopy.  He actually writes papers on it and he’s kind of an authority on doing the colonoscopy laparoscopically, which is something new(?).  You know, he only recently started doing that, I guess, 'cause it’s a complicated surgery.  The surgeon said it went great.  I mean, he said, “It was like without a hitch.  You hardly bled.”  ‘Cause they went into it, saying, “We’re going to go ahead and do it laparoscopically.  If there’s a complication, we may have to do it old school style, where they would have to cut you open.”  And he said, “There’s a possibility – we’re going to try to reconnect all plumbing, but there’s a possibility of having a coloscopy bag,” you know, which is like --  I was just like there’s --  You know, so the good news is the surgery went really, really well without hitch and all plumbing’s reconnected.  And he kept bringing students in.  Students were coming in going, “Oh, my God, wow, wow.”  It was, apparently like textbook surgery.  My surgeon told me, he said, “The thing about the fast,” he said, “sometimes the faster growing, the more aggressive tumors, actually respond better to treatment.”  So for whatever that’s worth.  And he said sometimes the slower growings are a little more difficult, they don’t respond as well 'cause I guess the more voracious ones sort of eat up the, you know --  But they’re responding --  I mean, I just had my first scan after four rounds of chemo this week, and got the results yesterday, and my large one, 6 centimeter one is back down to, it’s down to 4.9 now so it’s had a 20%, it’s 20% smaller after four rounds.  So the expectation of the oncologist is very --  Right now, see, I’m still in the process of being handed off to Kelly(?), so my oncologist right now is still the fellow at General.\",\n",
       " 'Surgery was January 5th.',\n",
       " 'So diagnosis was November 23rd, was the diagnosis, colonoscopy, diagnosis day.  Tests and scans, pre-surgery stuff in December.  I had surgery January 5th and I started chemo on, had my chest port placed on April 4th and I started chemo I think on, it was like the 6th of April.  I’ve had four rounds.',\n",
       " \"No, it was pretty much like, you know, you need to have the surgery like as soon as possible.  We would've even done it sooner except I went home for Christmas for two weeks, but I had the option of doing it over Christmas.  I could've done it like on Christmas day or the day before and I decided to put it off.  You may have questions that get to this later, but I did, along the way I made two very sort of critical decisions, which I feel [..?..] the quality of life, is that I could've done surgery sooner and everything would've been moved up sooner but I opted – because of my substance abuse problem I spoke of previously, I haven't been home in like a decade and I went home for two weeks at Christmas and went skiing, went to Colorado and went skiing and saw some close friends I hadn't seen in 20 --  I mean, I’m just kind of reconnecting my whole life after being disconnected, you know, estranged from like everybody in my life for like a long time.  And so that pushed everything back 'cause you have to wait like a couple months to completely heal from surgery before you start chemo, so it kind of did push everything back.  I also made --  They wanted to start chemo in March and I actually opted to postpone it and travel the whole month of March, 'cause I didn't know what was coming because I knew the severity of my situation.  And I didn't know if I was going to have another chance to do some things and, you know, if ever again.  So I traveled the month of March and it was kind of a big decision.  It was like okay, they need you to start treatment as soon as possible.  By the time I got done traveling, I wound up in the hospital with all kinds of pain, referred pain from --  The tumors had grown to a point where they were literally like bulging on other organs and causing excruciating pain.  And now I haven't had the pain since the tumors are shrinking.  But it was kind of one of the bigger, I mean, it was kind of a big decision.  And I actually totally actually feel like I made the right decision 'cause I had an incredible month of March and I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen in a long time.  It gave me a will, I mean, it kind of made me get a focus on why I really want to, you know, what’s out there to do.  And I did some of the things I love most.  I went to Rocky Mountain National Park and was like taking pictures of herds of elk at 14,000 feet in a frozen lake, you know, and went skiing and drove from Colorado to Texas.  I had a couple of reunions in Dallas with like friends I hadn't seen in 20 or 30 years.  So it was kind of a quality of life, you know, decision that I feel like actually is positively impacting my whole like sort of determination and is actually influencing now my decisions going forward.  ‘Cause based on that, it provides some options for me, like in relocating.  So it was definitely for me the right decision.  Other people were concerned.  People were like, “You need to get started on treatment.”  I was like, “Well you know what, I’m going to do this.”\",\n",
       " \"Well because like okay, well when you’re fighting like a threatening illness, which is, you know, the [..?..] statistics are there for a reason but – and I try not to pay too much attention to them, but they’re useful, right?  So it gives you a sense of the reality.  You know, 8% chance of surviving this, what that translates to is – it’s probability, right – it means probably I’m going to die from this in the next couple of years, probably.  I’m very determined – I mean, I’m in it to win it, you know.  But there’s also the reality of it, is like so when I say focus, like being focused on life and living and why do you want to live?  I kind of became like having purpose.  So if you want to live, why is it you need to live, why is it you want to live?  What is your motivation to live?  So going out and doing like the things --  I love traveling, I love being in the mountains, I love like skiing.  And these are all things that – 'cause remember, I lost my life for ten years.  Like I was living in the Tenderloin, I was an intravenous drug user with a bad drug problem.  I lost my career.  I had a very successful career as a film composer.  I lost all my friends and family.  The things I love to do most like music and composing and like all my close friends and traveling – and I used to go to the mountains all the time.  I used to travel and camp and ski.  So I haven't done any of these things in ten years.  So I’m reconnecting my life and going out and doing.  Instead of sitting in the Tenderloin in an SRO surrounded by junkies and drunks and just being in that environment, as opposed to like suddenly being, you know, being in national parks, skiing, being with my closest friends, who I’ve known all my life, who love me – like my friends from all --  You know, [..?..] Face Book.  It annoys me that I, that --  I mean, I would love to hate Face Book but I love it, you know, because I’ve reconnected.  ‘Cause I’d lost touch with every single person in my life, every single person, and now I’m in touch with like all my closest friends from every part of my life.  And even, like I was like a band geek in high school, you know, and all my close friends from band, like every day they’re – I mean, I talk to them every day and they’re all over the country.  And like they’ve all rallied around me, incredible rallied around me, and every day they check with me and they’re praying for me, you know.  And they all have different belief systems and a lot of them maybe are different than mine, but I’m incredibly appreciative with the way they’ve kind of risen to the occasion, so to speak.  So anyway, and so I was able --  When I was in Dallas I saw all these friends of mine and I went to dinner with them.  There was a party for me.  Like all these people I haven't seen since, you know, in three decades.  So that’s what I mean by focus.  It gave me like – I came back excited about like God, you know, here’s a great – I mean, there’s just a lot of reasons to live.  And also like I have options.  I don’t have to – I’m not stuck in the Tenderloin, 'cause sometimes it feels like – like I hate where I live.  I cannot stand it.  I just like [makes sound], which is kind of probably something – I’m not sure we’re going to get to it at some point, but decision-making stuff about like staying --  ‘Cause I made some decisions, huge decisions this week about --\",\n",
       " \"Okay, yeah.  So the decision-making things.  So I had this --  Okay, let me just back up and start with [..?..] or back even before that.  So going back to January, it was sort of like January --  Now I’m trying to just – yeah, so let me just figure out – speaking of focus.  Okay, Jed Horn, my surgeon, is telling me like, “Rex, you’re going to be all right,” you know, and I’m coming out of there all like --  Even though I’m stage IV, it’s just like why did my surgeon tell me that?  And so I just got very enthused and he said, yeah, you know, aggressive chemo and then probably, you know, he told me we’re expecting some radial(?) [..?..] ablation probably and then maybe liver resection and yada, yada.  And I was like cool, you know, [..?..] here, right?  You’re going to be all right.  So I’ve learned to ask questions for trying(?) to like define(?) --  So I go to define like terms.  You know, 'cause I go to my oncologist, Dr. Otterwile(?), at General.  He’s an odd(?) fellow.  I go in there and he’s just like, you know, “Okay, so we’re going to do chemo” and I’m asking questions like, “Okay, so how long do I do chemo?”  And he goes, “Well until it doesn't work anymore.”  “Okay, well what do you mean?  Wait ‘til it doesn't work anymore?”  He goes, “Well ‘til it doesn't work anymore.”  And I go, “Well how will we know that?”  He goes, “’Cause you’ll die.”  And I was like, “Wait, wait.  So you’re saying like I’m going to do chemo for the rest of my life?”  And he said, “Well we can change it up(?) at some point.”  He goes, “Well look.”  I remember he said that, “You know, you’re in good health, you’re in otherwise great health, no comorbidities, yada, yada, your age.  We feel like we stand a good chance of success with this.”  And I go, “Okay, let’s define success.  ‘Cause maybe we have different ideas.”  And he goes, “Well maybe up to a year, two years.”  I go, “Wait, wait.  Stop.”  ‘Cause I’ll never forget that moment.  I was like, “Excuse me.  Let me just see if I understanding this.  You’re defining success if I live two years?”  And he’s like, “Well yeah.”  And I’m just like – I remember the room kind of getting kind of like – I was just like, “Whoa, whoa.  Wait.  This is like a long ways from like ‘I think you’re going to be all right,’ right?”  I remember wanting to get out of there.  It was like I’m done.  And he was just like, “Next.”  I mean, the whole thing was just like [rattles papers], and I went in there and then there was a social worker waiting for me to come out of the room, and just takes you in another room.  “I understand you got some bad news.”  I’m just sitting there going like, “What the hell is going on?”  And then all of a sudden it’s kind of clear(?).  Okay, you’re right.  You’ve got 8%, right.  Okay, I’m now I’m reading the thing and it says right there that, you know, we’re looking at up to 2-year survival rates, you know.  And now I’m saying, “Well what about radial(?) [..?..] ablation, what about [..?..] and all those things?”  And he says, “That would require” – he goes, “That’s not really options in your case and it’d require a dramatic profound success, which not ruling it out but that it’s not really what we expect, but it’s possible.  But that would require dramatic results from the chemo.”  So I was just like wow.  Anyway, I went away from that just kind of dismayed.  That was kind of my lowest point.  I went away and I was just like…  ‘Cause up to that point maybe I was a bit Pollyanna, you know, I’m going to beat this, I’m going to be the 8%.  And now it’s [..?..] going like okay, wow, okay.  And I was like that and so the social worker said, “Well what happened?”  “My surgeon told me I’m going to be all right, you know, and my oncologist says he’s measuring success if I live two years.”  She said, “Well we see this a lot.  Surgeons are very, they do a great job.  Surgeons are very optimistic, they build a lot of expectations.”  She goes, “This is very common, and the oncologist come in, they kind of bring you down like to reality.”  I’m like okay.  So I went away from that and I was just dismayed.  And I talked to my best friend Donna in Denver.  And she’s just like, “Rex, he’s not even an oncologist.  He’s an onc fellow.  You’ve got to talk to somebody else.”  And so I had this idea.  I thought well you know what, what do you want from oncologists?  So I wrote a mission statement and I tell you --  And so by this time I had my appointment with Katie Kelly, but I typed it up and printed it out and I took it in to her.  And it was like, “Looking for an oncologist who’s as passionate about beating this as I am.  I’m looking for an oncologist who values an integrated approach to oncology,” something – we never talked about it – but something I’m very interested in, integrative oncology.  I was excited because Dahl(?) Abrahm’s(?) the head of Oncology at General.  He’s the nation’s lead proponent of integrative oncology.  And I asked my oncologist about it and he’s just like, “Oh, well, you don’t have the right insurance for that,” or something.  He dismissed it just like –  [..?..] the head of the Department was like, you know – so I said, “I’m looking for an oncologist who values the integrative approach to oncology.”  I said, “I’m looking for someone who sees life as the end game, not death, and someone who’s in it to win it.”  So I typed this up and brought it in to Katie Kelly and I read it to her and she said, “Rex” – and I loved her from the beginning.  She just had a great presence.  You know, I could tell she was like passionate about what she does.  I mean, you get a sense of these things.  Instead of being like, “Next, next,” she spent like an hour, hour and a half, she spent a long time with me, talked to me in depth about the disease.  The first thing she said after I called her and kind of told her my story, read it to her, and she said, “Rex, when somebody your age and your health comes in, the Plan A is to cure the disease.”  And I was like nobody has used the word ‘cure’ yet, right, so I feel like I’m in the right place.  I was like thank you.  So she laid out Plan A, Plan B, Plan C and I’m just like okay, this is great now.  So here’s where the big huge thing that I’ve since dealt with like has become my --  So now, 'cause like I say, otherwise I’d be out of San Francisco.  I’m ready to --  I was like, I want to go live with friends and family.  I have friends that are like, “You come live with us.”  Between treatments I got a car.  My parents helped me get a car, which has freed me up and I’ve been going --  So between treatments, I’ve been just going to like national parks and camping.  I’ve been by myself, just like going to Yosemite, going to Joshua Tree, going in the desert, going out.  But also in these places I have family – there are friends or people.  So I’ve been getting out of the Tenderloin and I’m with friends/family and they have kids.  And it’s like I wake up every morning, “Good morning, Rex,” and I’m with people, right?  I’m doing something and just being out of the city and you know, just like with yards and trees and families and it’s just like this is what I want.  So now what’s been difficult is like so now I’m going – I really want to work with Katie Kelly.  I mean, I feel like she’s the oncologist I’m looking for.  At the same time, I’m going like, you know, I really want to get out of here.  So this is what I’ve been thinking about and looking at and considering, like where am I going to go.  Like am I going to go to Southern California?  I’ve got cousins in Joshua Tree area, actually live out there, and family and they have some land and corn(?).  I was just down there and I can go live down there, stay there and kind of, you know, in which case I would change my treatment to UCLA or something and commute to L.A. for treatment.  Or even I was thinking I could commute the eight hours every two weeks.  I don’t mind driving, coming to, back to San Francisco.  Every week I have to work with Dr. Kelly and --  Or what I really want to do is I want to go to Denver and one, because I have really close friends.  I have my friend Donna and her husband and her family.  She’s an oncology nurse.  She understands what’s going on.  And also, because the reality of the situation is that things could take a turn.  You know, the reality is that there’s a really good chance I can die this next year too.  My oncologist even told me yesterday, he said, “Look, this is great.  We’re seeing success.  That’s what we expect to see.  What we also expect is that at some point it’s going to become resistant and so we change things up and we” – you know, and I understand that.  So in which case I don’t want to be here by myself, you know.  You know, I just, I don’t.  So it’s kind of been I’m really torn.  So I’ve been waiting for that appointment with Dr. Kelly, and Donna’s actually flying out to go to that appointment with me.  And so I talk about this every day.  So as I’ve come to understand more about disease and based on what the new scans say is that, you know, they’re being successful but when I ask about, “Well at what point will we see dramatic success?  Let’s say hypothetically(?) we see dramatic success.  So at what point [..?..] our options when we see that?”  And he said, “You know, it’s probably another two, three months.”  I said, “Like six months, three months, a year?”  He goes, “Well not a year 'cause we don’t expect after a year something’s(?) going to have a dramatic success.  So the next two or three months are going to be critical.”  And I expect --  I’m going to go in to see Dr. Kelly and because I had so much comments(?), they’re all [..?..] and kind of consult with her on this whole decision-making, but I’ve kind of already made the decision.  I just decided this week I’m just --  I just had another great time out of the city, I’ve got to get out of San Francisco, I’ve got to get out of the Tenderloin.  And I feel like the tradeoff for quality of health, quality of life, if I’m going to see dramatic success, also too I feel like it’s going to definitely help just --  So I’m looking at moving.  Basically I’ve decided to move next month.  I mean, I’ve got an operational plan.  I’m putting in notice.  So by the end of July I’m going to be living in Colorado.  I’m going to be in the mountains.  It’s great there in the summertime.  It means that --  I’m more excited than I’ve been in ten years.  Now of course, you know, changes – of course there’s -- to face the one thing that could change it – if I walk in there and Dr. Kate Kelly said, “Look, I want to do an ablation or something and” – like if she’s putting things on the calendar in August or September and says, “Look, Rex” --  Like if there’s something quantitative, like a reason to stay, I’ll do that, but otherwise – but what I expect is probably she’s going to say, “Let’s keep the [..?..] treatment.  Let’s see what happens in three months.”  And so then I’m going to talk to her about it and I think she’ll get my reasons for wanting to move and Donna’s going to be there to help me kind of really make sure that, you know --  But short of her saying, scheduling something, putting something on the calendar, if it’s just to do more treatment, when she’s already told me last week, she said, “Wherever you go right now you’re going to be the same, you’re going to do the same chemo.  That would be the same wherever and you can get that anywhere.”  So I can go to U.C. Denver, U.C. Colorado, you know, Medical Center of Denver, and get the same treatment.  Also it means that I think just improving my quality of life and really being happy and just having that kind of support is only going to --  ‘Cause the next two or three months are going to be the most critical if I’m going to see this dramatic success.  And I do believe the whole integrative thing.  I believe that improving my quality of life and not hating where I live every day, you know, and not having to share a bathroom --  You know, 'cause I share a bathroom down the hallway with junkies and drunks and stuff.  I mean, just like I’m going to live in a house with a yard and trees and family, friends I’ve known since I was 12 years old and who love me like --  And I’m going to have her for support and be able to some day(?) – go to appointments --  Right now I go to appointments myself, I come home and do chemo by myself.  I just think that --  So that’s kind of the decision I made this week.  Again, you know, this plan’s, if --  But what my plan is too is to go in with Katie Kelly and I’m not going to tell her that initially because I want to see what she has, I want to see what she, her understanding or her assumption that I’m going to be here to get treatment.  I want to see what her plan is because I’m going to use that as a yardstick for – I mean, that’s what I --  ‘Cause I’m going to find an oncologist --  I want [..?..] 'cause I really love her and I just --  And also, I talked to Dr. [..?..].  He said, “Look, you can even consult with her for second opinions on big decisions.  People do that.  They find UCSF for second opinions on making key decisions,” and that’s been recommended to me anyway.  So I would like to keep --  I’ve only had one appointment with her but I think extremely highly of her and I have a lot of confidence in her.  I know that she’s speaking the way --  And she’s also a specialist.  She’s also like really --  And I’m hoping that she may be able to help me with a referral, you know, in making the transition, 'cause that’s my next thing.  Donna’s helping me in Denver like to try to get a referral to a specialist there, you know, and someone who will take Medicaid.  We’ve got to get all that transferred and stuff too.  So I mean, there’s [..?..] probably packing up the trailer and going.  I mean, I don’t have much stuff.  So that’s sort of been the big decision.  I mean, I’ve been kind of coming at this for a while, but in the last 48 hours I’ve made that decision and it’s the most life-affirming thing, just having made that decision and like knowing that I’ve got a plan, you know, that just not sort of this endless --  I actually feel even more determined to like – I’m like excited about things, you know.  I mean, I was excited about these trips and every time I go out of town I’m excited, but this is that times ten.  ‘Cause it’s always like I’m going to leave town, I’m going to come back.  And so now I feel like I’m going to go and I’m changing my life.  But that’s been the whole process of decision-making over the last three months.  You know, I could say it’s kind of culminated with this decision to relocate, so I’ve got a date on the calendar, you know.  So it gives context, also it’s great 'cause it gives context to everything I’m doing now.  Like every day now I get up with like purpose of like okay, I need to – I’ve got a punch list of what I’ve got to do and so everything has like, again, focus.  And it’s just, you know, it gets me busy.  It’s a big project, moving.  It’s like exciting, you know.  And I know, it’s also I’m going oh, my God, in July I’m going to be pulling a trailer, you know, driving to Colorado and, you know, so I’m really, really excited about it actually.\",\n",
       " \"I’ve always believed --  I mean, I used to have a very successful business in San Francisco, a music production company, and I was doing, scoring music for TV and film and doing Nike Super Bowl ads, I mean, doing kind of high profile stuff and I had a great life.  So from being a business owner and from building a career --  It wasn't like I got up one day and say I’m going to do this.  I spent years paying my dues.  I was in L.A. for ten years, you know, getting in the industry, learning that craft.  Just somewhere along the way I became, you know, became aware of the idea of mission statements, you know, in businesses.  You know, it’s kind of like the whole Frank Colby(?) thing, you know, and [..?..], how you affect people, you know.  And it kind of became a real – I guess in the nineties, I think, it seemed like it was maybe, it became like, you know, almost like conventional wisdom and – you know, mission statements.  Businesses have mission statements and organizational, a successful organization, that’s where you start, right?  Mission statements.  I’ve written them before.  I’ve written them for my business, I’ve written them when I’ve had big projects or projects, you know.  I’ve always found them very useful.  I also have, for myself, twenty years ago, which I used to live by and I now brought it back to life, I wrote actually a personal Constitution.  Like, you know, the country has a Constitution and everything you do, you, is it constitutional?  So it’s kind of the same idea, like something to focus and guide.  So I’m not sure exactly where the idea came from but I remember I was really dismayed by my oncologist.  I was just like really depressed about it, and I was going okay, I need to find another oncologist.  And so I knew – and so I had this appointment at UCSF, not knowing – I mean, I’ve only had one oncologist.  So I don't know what any of yours are going to be like.  And so, 'cause I was thinking about maybe going to L.A. or going to Denver and I’m thinking like --  Oh, here’s part of where it came from, is that --  Well this maybe – I don't know if this was before or after.  Yeah, this is before.  I met somebody on cancer forums early on, I mean, I was going to cancer forums as part of my research and [..?..] asked some great questions.  And you get a lot, you get stuff from all places(?).  You know, if somebody’s talking too much about Jesus or if they can’t use Spell-check and don’t write complete sentences, I have trouble taking them – not that they don’t have valid things to say but like there was one individual who was really an articulate writer, very thorough writing, and he valued spirituality and he’s like a Christian family man, all that kind of stuff, but he wasn't like off on like Jesus – he was like giving really rational responses, very complete, and intelligence in his balance and his insights – really struck me.  I found them very helpful.  Also he’s my exact same age, exact same diagnosis and he’s three years ahead of me.  So I kind of formed a relationship with him, just, you know, was corresponding with him.  Then it turned out that he lives two miles from my mother and stepfather in Dallas, in Grapevine(?).  So when I was there in March I went and had lunch with him, met him, and it was great.  So he kind of told me --  This was kind of very interesting, another football analogy, right?  He said, “Rex, you’ve got to think of it like it’s a sports team, you know, it’s your team, and all these different people, the oncologist is the quarterback and all the other players.  The oncologist is calling the plays and running the game and they’re the most important person.  But you’re on the team and you can’t just like trust it to – you’ve got to be looking at the numbers and looking at the stats.  You’ve got to like keep on top of everything.  And if the quarterback’s not working for you and the team’s not performing right, you have to restart.  You get a new quarterback, right?”  ‘Cause I was talking about my dismay with my – and he said, “You’ve got to get a new quarterback.”  So that’s what I was kind of thinking about.  So I came back and I got this appointment with Dr. Kelly and so I was just thinking about it.  I’m trying to remember where it just came from.  But I was thinking about it.  So I write a lot.  I do a lot of writing.  So I was just making some notes about what am I looking for.  So I was making notes about what I’m looking for.  Oh, it’s about going to all my appointments.  This is what happened.  I remember now, this is what happened.  I always make notes before I go into an appointment, I write questions, write notes, and so I was writing stuff down and I kind of started thinking, what am I looking for?  Who’s my quarterback, who to look for.  A kind of light bulb went off and I said I needed a mission statement.  So then it condenses out, all these notes, so basically I condensed it down to like what are the key --  You know, I’m looking for an oncologist who’s passionate about beating this, as I am, you know.  And I didn't put this in the mission statement but I kind of thought someone who’s got an ego about it, someone who like takes it personally, who really wants to succeed and wants like --  And so, and you’re thinking that’s probably why UCSF is number seven.  You have people like Kate Kelly.  ‘Cause she [..?..] 'cause she’s like into it, right?  I mean, you feel that from a person.  So I wanted an oncologist who’s passionate about beating it as I am, someone who values the integrative approach to oncology, someone who sees life as the end game, not death, who’s like --  I mean, we get that it’s like, it’s terminal.  I mean, I think that’s – I understand that.  But our goal, like she says, is a cure and so that’s – you know, she put the bar a little higher.  Instead of setting(?) the measure(?) in two years, she put the bar a little higher.  So if you shoot higher, you’re going to go higher, you know.  So maybe I --  And then but really like someone who’s in it to win it.  So I wrote it down, I typed it up.  I was really going like this is cool and I still use it every day.  And now I’m going to look for an oncologist in Denver and I’m going to use the same – you know, and I’m using --  Katie Kelly kind of said --  I really love too that even if I don’t really go forward with treatment with her, but she just really set the bar high, I feel like, you know, and that’s good.  And I know anything less than what she’s done, there’s a Plan A, B and C.  She used words, like she said, “Rex, what we’d like, what we have to do is we put, employ a dianetic(?) process,” which I get that, you know, that as we go along, we learn the intelligence of the disease, we adapt to it, you know.  I think of it like insurgent(?), you know, like military.  I think things work well.  Like the main invading army has been ousted from my colon but there’s insurgencies, you know, terrorists, who are like well entrenched in my liver, right?  And so you have to like hit them, like shock them.  You have to go in – it’s a counter-insurgency.  You’ve got to hit them hard.  And I did.  And so just like terrorists or insurgents, you’re never going to get rid of all of them.  There’s always going to be some cell that’s going to persist and exist, but you can contain them and really reduce their influence so they don’t spread to other, invade other, and they don’t have influence on other organs.  So I kind of think of it like that.  And so, you know…\",\n",

       " \"Hospitalized, hospitalized permanently, like, you know, inside for [..?..], you know, like with all this.  Because then people come to visit you.  Me, I’ll feel more bad about them, you know, having to, like when you go to a hospital and everybody, the way they approach the people to it.  Like some people go to hospital to complain to you about, “Oh, you know, when I was in the hospital,” this and this and that.  When somebody’s in a hospital lying in bed and somebody come and like there’s people like very cheerful, people like come to erase(?) the problem to you when you’re in the hospital.  You know, everybody approach it differently.  Me, I’ve seen that one even when I was here two days in the hospital for the one time.  It’s like the only time I be in the hospital, two days I think.  I look [..?..] my life(?) here.  And then you would tell nobody I went to the hospital.  The next morning(?) tell, “You know what, my work, I called my work.  And then – who was it?  I think one of my workers called here and was asking, “Hey, you know when Danny’s going to get out?”  I said, “Get out from where?”  “From the hospital.”  “What do you mean the hospital?”  Oh, it became like a big --  And then they were like calling my cell phone.  “Hello?”  “Where are you?”  And then like suddenly like 50 people try to come to the house(?), my wife, my brother-in-law from over there, my family from here, or San Francisco.  When you put them together, you fill a room over hundred people.  Yeah, I know, especially with those bodies(?).  And then that’s why, God.  [..?..]…  I said, “Well, are  you those people?  I mean, you?”  “Of course.”  “Then why would I tell you?  I choose to tell you or no.”  I only got(?) off(?) one.  See, even told them, I said, “I mean, me, I love to be here in the hospital.  I’ve never been to it.  They feed you and you watch TV all day.  I don’t get to do that much.  I mean, I pay – even in the hospital you can leave in the morning and say, ‘Can I stay until after lunch?’”  I say, “What do you mean?”  “The lady told me they’re going to have this potato something.”  “Okay.”  That’s why I say my wife said, “Let’s get out.”  I said, “Wait for lunch and then we’ll leave after lunch, and then watch the TV a little bit more.”  “Well you can do that at home.”  I said, “Yeah, but over there you’d probably find me something to do.  ‘Let’s go shopping, this family coming.  Let’s go buy this.’  See, you have very active life because you only see me one day or two days a week, everybody come to the house.  They bring coffee, I make some coffee and then they bring some bread and bread and all these things, it become like a big crowd.  Like [..?..] and I go there like once a week, all my family, my sister-in-law, her husband and kids.  We come, we come get together.  And then like the house is full of people.  And then by the time, it’s [..?..] time taken away.  But I mean, I don’t see [..?..], I mean, I’m in my family but sometimes I just want to oh, watch TV and relax and cooking or something.  But they always like, “We’re going to go buy this” and then my family come and then they don’t want the same thing I want and then okay.  I don’t get that much for a long time, yeah.  That’s why when I was hospitalized(?) I said man, watch TV and watch --  Like today I was going to watch something and then my boss(?), “Hey, can we go to [..?..]?”  I said, “I can’t, man,” because they want me to go [..?..] my work and then just driving [..?..] or put in my name and just take the car, the rental car, for in my name but just take you [..?..].  I can’t(?) drive them(?) 'cause I’ve got a [..?..].  Like all these people calling me also for, “Hey, can we get a car, can give you me a car, can you give me this?”  I got a phone call, like very busy, that’s why I always busy.  “Hello?”  “Hey, man, can you give me a car for Saturday?”  Or my all friends, that’s why they call me, or even people who know(?) my friends too.  That’s why [..?..] always busy.  Sometimes I turn off and then, if I turn on my cell phone, everybody going to be coming to my house, here, and they know when I’m here, or they go over there.  They go, “Hey, Danny okay?”  “Danny’s okay.  And why?”  “Well call him”, duh, duh, duh.  “No, he’s okay.”  Because now they know that I’m in this, so now it’s like more like --\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, but also they’ll be, “But you okay?”  Like, “You feel like, you know, what happen if you did” --  “Don’t worry about it, man.”  I said, “Just don’t lend me money, man.  ‘Cause I ain’t going to pay you.”  That’s how I approach it.  I don’t worry about much of it.  But like I said, quality of life is that.  ‘Cause maybe, I mean, probably be home in El Salvador, my mom, me.  Just because I get along with her.  I mean, at home over there I would never – I used to take vacation there, like three or four days.  I’d be sitting there in my shorts and, you know, not shorts but watching TV.  Like, my mom, “Are you okay?”  “Yeah.”  She just let me be, like watching TV.  Everybody going out to the ocean and all these things and I’m just --  And now bringing my wife, went to the ocean, got sunburned 'cause I forgot about put cream.  And then [..?..] sand and my wife say, “Oh, put some sand, honey,” and I forgot.  I removed my – and I got burned a little bit now.  My wife said, “Oh, forgot.  I’m sorry, honey.”  ‘Cause she saw the big burn.  “Oh, man,” I say, “Yeah, I told you about it but it’s my fault.  Don’t worry about it.”\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, right.  But I was using 40 or 60 sunscreen and with the hot and everything.  But then when the ocean – and it’s still the shock of being there, then she’d swimming.  She love the ocean.  She hadn't been in El Salvador for 24 year.  “Honey, come.”  “Okay, I’m here.  Okay.”  “Come, come.”  And then I went there like and like then with my [..?..]…  And she put some here and then that’s why it got sunburned.  And then, “Oh, I’m sorry.”  I said, “Don’t worry about it.  Those thing happen.  My fault for forgetting about it.  I forgot about the cream.  You remove the cream.  “No, but it’s my fault.”  I said, “Don’t worry about it.”  That’s my point.  If somebody got something, don’t worry about it.  Like I told my wife, in my life I never had time to hold grudges to anybody.  Even when your customer says, you know, “Wonder what he did, yeah, with the house(?) and my credit thing.  I don’t even [..?..].  Welcome to my house.  I mean, you know he messed me up.”  “I know he messed you up real bad with money.”  “Yeah, but I don’t hold a grudge.  With money you can replace any time.  Friends, you can’t.  That’s the way I approach things.\",\n",

       " 'Yeah, it was like two months ago now, I think.',\n",
       " \"Oh, yeah, right.  [chuckles]  Okay, so I was actually diagnosed with rectal cancer April of 2009 and it started with --  I was completely asymptomatic: no pain, no bowel movement issues, no weight loss.  I mean, there was literally nothing that would indicate that I had any kind of issue, except for a little blood on the toilet paper after a bowel movement.  But, you know, easy bowel movements, you know, again no pain.  So my primary care doctor suggested, since I was 47 at the time, yeah, close to 50, “Let’s go ahead – it’s probably nothing, but let’s go ahead and do a colonoscopy.”  So I did the colonoscopy and found a 2 millimeter tumor in my rectum, upper rectum, and then obviously had to go in for further tests.  Now at the time I was actually doing this all through CPMC and even though I had helped my parents – both my parents died of different types of cancers – even though I’d helped them in terms of research and going to get second opinions and all that kind of stuff, I think I was a little – so surprised by this that I was actually going to continue with CPMC until my really good friend, Janet, said, “You know, Jay, you’ve done so much with your parents in terms of second opinions.  How come you aren’t getting second opinions?”  So gee, she sort of woke me up.  And I said, “Yeah, you’re right.”  So I did some more research, found Dr. Vernook as one of the leading colorectal cancer specialists, was able to get an appointment with [..?..] Kismet(?).  You know, he was booked for --  I was going to start my regimen of treatment at CPMC within ten days, but I was able to get an appointment to see Dr. Vernook within that time.  I guess somebody else had cancelled their appointment.  So long story short, because this is a long story, through additional tests that were done it was determined that the cancer had metastasized to my lungs, so I’ve got about 20 to 30 very small nodules in my lungs, which of course then made me Stage IV.  And then with Dr. Vernook --  I met with him the first time and I could tell immediately that, you know, he knew what he was talking about.  You know, my gut instinct was he was very honest, very forthright, very knowledgeable and what he was recommending in terms of a treatment plan made a lot of sense to me.  I very much operate on logic and so if it sounds logical and, you know, based on a lot of the research I had done, it made sense.  So I did six cycles of chemo, of FOLFIRI.  Then I had my surgery to actually remove the rectal tumor and had a temporary ileostomy for seven months.  I did six more cycles of chemo after the surgery.  I had the ileostomy removed April of 2010 and actually for all of 2010, I was treatment-free.  Outside of the surgery in April, I didn't have any more chemo, I didn't have any radiation.  So 2010 was a pretty good year.  I came in for a Valentine’s Day PET CT scan of this year and that’s when they found that the cancer had metastasized to my T10 vertebrae.  So with that, I met with Dr. Shannon Fog, who’s a radiologist at Parnassus, specializes in cancer along the spine.  Additional MRIs found that it was also in my L5 so my T10 and my L5.  And so we did a cyber-knife treatment for those two.  Man, I would recommend that in a heartbeat.  Have you ever done a – I mean, do you know what cyber knife is?\",\n",
       " 'It’s amazing.  It’s a one-time, at least in my case it was a one-time radiation treatment where I laid down on a table and the robot arm, it’s constantly swiveling, hitting that one spot at different angles.  So it hits it about 40 or 50 different times but at completely different angles so only that one spot gets the radiation 40 or 50 times.  And I did it twice.  One for the L5 and one for the T10 and that was it.  No side effects, nothing.  But then I started chemo again to try to get at the remaining cancer, and that’s when you met me.  So I had just finished --  Let me see, when was that?  I’m not sure.  Was I starting chemo or was I maybe in the middle of chemo?  I’m not sure but it was right around that time that you and I met.  Turns out that I may have cancer now in the right clavicle up here, but they’re not sure.  So we did two more cycles of chemo and I’m going in Monday for some more PET CT scans.  And that’s where we’re at.',\n",
       " 'Right.  Oh, okay, okay.  So yeah.',\n",
       " \"Yes, I did.  So the reason I ended up at CPMC is my primary care doctor is there, the gastroenterologist that did the colonoscopy was there, so sort of a natural progression basically to stay there.  But what happened is when I met with the oncologist, he is a general oncologist.  He doesn't necessarily specialize in any type of cancer and while I’m sure he’s really knowledgeable and all that, I realized, again after doing a lot more research, that I really needed to get a specialist.  And being so close to UCSF or Stanford, you know, I should be able to get somebody who specializes in colorectal cancer.  So having been able to do the research, find Dr. Vernook and getting the appointment, you know, meeting him for the first time, it was a no-brainer, although it was difficult to tell my oncologist that I had met twice at CPMC that I wasn't going to be working with him anymore.  But he was very good about it.\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, very understanding.',\n",
       " \"Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I mean, again, you know, I’ve never been afraid of doctors.  I’m a guy who will go when he needs to go, and I’m not sure why I went.  Because it wasn't an issue and it actually stopped.  I mean, I actually went to see him December of ’08 but then my father was dying so I didn't – I wasn't able to do the colonoscopy until April.  And, you know, in January the bleeding stopped.  So I mean, hell, I could may not have been ever diagnosed until it was way too late.\",\n",
       " 'Uh-huh.',\n",
       " \"I probably wouldn't have waited.  I know myself.  I’d be okay, let’s get going on this, let’s get started, and I really was going to start.  I mean, I saw him – he has clinic on Wednesdays so I saw him on a Wednesday and my treatment at CPMC would've started the following Monday.  And had I not been able to see him that Wednesday, I would've started my treatment, which would've been chemo and radiation, and with Dr. Vernook, all I did was chemo.\",\n",
       " 'And then surgery and then chemo again, right.',\n",
       " 'Well I mean, he did have that cancellation and --  Well I think it’s because he had the cancellation.  I was able to get in.  I mean, you know, I sort of -- [chuckles] – I’m laughing only because I have a sales background and so with his scheduler, I was talking – I forget the gentleman’s name at the time; he has since left – I talked to him several times and was persuasive, I think, in terms of trying to get in to see him.  In a good way, in a good way.',\n",
       " 'Well and I stopped by, I stopped by physically.  I mean, I only live ten blocks away so – and asked to speak with the scheduler and thanked him profusely for trying to do whatever he could to get me in.  And so I think when the cancellation happened, I was the first person he called to see if I could come.',\n",

But she just has a natural affinity and interest in it.  And, you know, she’s one of my best friends and so we talk several times a week, if not every day.  So she was as shocked as I was when I got the diagnosis and she’s a good sounding board so I talked to her a lot about what was going on.  She’d ask me some good questions.  And she was the one who, again, really brought up the fact that I had not received a second opinion yet and, you know, shouldn't I go ahead and do that.  And it made perfect sense.  I mean, I did it for my parents.  I mean, there’s no reason why I shouldn't have done it for myself, but I guess I wasn't thinking as straight as I should've been thinking.\",\n",

But no, when working with my folks, it was different.  I didn't necessarily need Janet’s advice to know what to do and all that.  I think for me, when it’s for somebody else it’s a lot easier.

I forget the exact name of the operation that was done.  And I don’t think that operation did her very well.  So she died within 18 months of the diagnosis.  Yeah, and what’s interesting with my mom is -- she was 75 when she passed.  She was a pretty mild, quiet woman but she really fought and she did not want to let go.  She died at home, in hospice, but she did not want to let go.  She really wanted to stay on.  Whereas my dad, who’s always been the life of the party and, you know, big personality and funny guy and very passionate, when he died of Stage IV melanoma, he was ready to go.  He was like, “Okay, now it’s my time.  I don’t want anybody to have to wipe my butt and feed me through with a spoon.  I’m ready to go.”  And he died within 36 hours of entering hospice.',\n",
       " 'No, he was only ill for a year.  And in fact, he was diagnosed January of ’08 and died February of ’09, and he was actually in pretty good shape for those first ten months and then he started the downhill slide late November or December of ’08.',\n",
       " \"You know, she obviously was in a lot of pain.  I’d say the last two weeks she was mostly out of it, somewhat conscious at times and mostly out of it.  And she just really --  It’s hard for me to explain.  You know, she was better in those last couple of weeks as well.  She just wasn't ready to leave.  She did not want to leave.

We found a neuroendocrine oncologist again -- very hard to find -- at Cedar Sinai down in Los Angeles.  That’s where I grew up.  And so we started going to see him and I’d fly down for those appointments and she was on a Sandostatin regimen, which is like a chemo drug.  I think it’s a biologic actually.  And she was willing to do it and put up with the side effects.  She wanted to do the surgery, I mean, she was all for the surgery, even though obviously, you know, there are always risks associated with that, and she wanted to do the second surgery to get more of the cancer in the liver.  So she was actually --  I was surprised at how aggressive she was.  And you know, we would sit down and we’d talk.  I said, “You know, mom, this is completely up to you.  How do you want to deal with this?  What do you want to do?”  And she said, “I want to be aggressive with this.”  So she was aggressive during her treatment but then in the actual dying process, it was – she wasn't ready to let go.\",\n",

I was more the medical consultant kind of, you know, “Well let’s take a look at this and let’s do this research,” you know, I would talk to the doctors, I’d go down there for any major meetings with the doctors, you know, that kind of deal.  My dad – I love you dad – but my dad was, could be a very cynical kind of guy and not necessarily trusting, and also very frustrated with how long things take.  You know what it’s like.  I mean, you could be at a doctor’s office and even though your appointment’s at 10, they don’t see you until 12, and that would just drive him crazy.

I’d go into different organizations’ websites to see who wrote up articles and who was on web boards and all those types of things to find out who would be the primary colorectal specialist here in the Bay Area.  But then I also was able to then find out, you know, what are the standards of care for Stage III and Stage IV rectal cancer, you know, what are some of the options, you know, all that, so that I could be better informed and understand when I would meet with, you know, in this case Dr. Vernook, you know, what he was saying, and allow me to then be able to ask follow-up questions.',\n",
       " 'Yeah, I would say the medical websites were the best and I’m really bad with names.  I write lots of things down.  There is a really good website that’s primarily used by doctors, although patients can get on there as well, that had I thought the best information about cancer in general but specifically about colorectal cancer, specifically about rectal cancer.  Because even though they’re similar, there are differences.  So I would go on that website.  I have a friend who is a doctor and he allowed me access to one of the databases that he has access to.  So I’d go in and, you know, it’s obviously a double-edged sword, right, because you read some of these things and you’re like oh, my God, this is what I have to look forward to?  You know, that’s sort of scary but okay, that’s fine.  At least I know.  Better armed and forewarned.  And you’ve got to be careful, obviously you have to be careful when you get some of these weird websites where they would recommend this enema or that supplement or whatever.  And again, I think I’ve got a pretty good filter for those types of things so I could easily filter those out.',\n",
       " 'Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, and that was the main website.  Again, I wish I remembered it, but that was the one I probably referred to the most, I mean, both for --  I mean, again, it would be all aspects of colorectal cancer including the surgical options, the chemo options, the radiation options, to get a better understanding of what I would be – what were the choices or the potential options for me going forward.',\n",

You know, it may not be” --  You know, he basically says, “This is what I know,” which means “I don't know everything but this is what I know.”  And so he’s really good about it.  I don’t fall apart, I don’t --  Like when given the news about the bone metastasis.  It’s like literally it’s like well okay, that sucks but okay, now what are we going to do?  You know, what’s the next thing?  I mean, I realize that this is going to progress.  You know, hopefully it’s going to take a lot longer than not but that’s the way it’s going to work.\",\n",

And that’s why --  So what was interesting – and again, I apologize if you were at this appointment, when he – Dr. Vernook basically said, “You know, Jay, we’re not sure it’s cancer in the right clavicle.  We really don’t know.”  And again, that’s what I really appreciate about him.  I mean, he’s just real honest about it.  And I said, “Okay, well what does that mean?”  And he goes, “Well I mean, we could do radiation on it but what I’d like to do is two more cycles of the Folfox chemo to see if it either has any effect on the clavicle” – and plus, I’m also doing Xgeva, which is a shot specifically, it’s a medicine specifically designed for bone metastases, to deal with them and to hopefully prevent them.  So he wanted me to continue with the Xgeva, do two more cycles of chemo and then do the PET CT scans again.  So we’re going to see -- you know, on Wednesday when I see him, a week from today, he’ll let me know what they found on the latest PET CT scan that I’ll be doing on Monday.  I will tell you, I mean, I’ll be honest, when I found out in June about the bone mets, I came home after the appointment, talked to Janet – Janet was the first person that I talked to – and we actually went out to dinner that night.  And, you know, my first thought is okay, well this is definitely again another serious thing that needs to be dealt with, but I started thinking about mortality again.  It’s like well I need to [..?..] my trust and, you know, just do some odds and ends.  But it’s like, but, you know, but I’m going to move forward and do what needs to be done.  I mean, I want to get cracking on this one.  So I’ll be honest, I had to press to get the appointments that I needed to get to get the more detailed MRIs and to move forward with the Radiation Department.

I said, “I want to be very clear.  Love UCSF, getting best care there, you know, wonderful.  But” --  Because what happened is they sat me down and they started giving me the premeds.  I mean, I was always hooked up.  I was getting steroids, I was getting the Ativan, and that’s when they found out that they didn't have the 5-FU.  So they should've not given me the premeds, right?  So I wasn't upset.  I was surprised and really I was surprised.  It was like well how can this happen?  How can you not have the drug?  And not UCSF; I mean, it’s really more how could the drug not be available?  And so I asked the pharmacist, Zoe, “Can you tell me who actually manufacturers it?”  She came back and she had a printout of the three manufacturers and I went home and I literally --  I should've gone back to work but I literally spent the rest of the afternoon researching once again, you know, and sending off emails and, you know, sending off emails to APP and Myland(?) and TEBA(?), the three manufacturers.  I found the summary of the drug shortages summit meeting of November 5, 2010, printed that out and read through that.  So obviously it was like okay, I’ve got to understand what’s going on.  And then the next day I reached out to the American Association of Health System Pharmacists and they called me back and we talked.  And they asked me whether or not I’d be willing to, you know, participate in any kind of reportage.  And I said absolutely.  I mean, you know, we’ve got to get this word out.  So that’s how I got --  The Chronicle contacted me and then the New York Times contacted me through the Colo Cancer Alliance, which I’m a part of.  I’m a buddy within that group, so I work with other people who have been recently diagnosed and as, you know, just as somebody that they can talk to who’s been through it and is going through it.\",\n",

He called me at home, says, “Okay, so this is a great article.  You know, would you be willing to do more lobbying?”  And I said, “Absolutely.  I mean, if one good thing can come out of my cancer and I can help in this regard, I’m more than happy to do it.”',\n",

But then there’s all the other drugs too, beyond the chemo drugs, that people don’t know about because they don’t know what drugs they’re given while they’re in the hospital, right?  I mean, you’re in surgery.  You don’t know what drugs you’re given, but all of a sudden that drug’s not available and the anesthesiologist has to come up with something else.

I mean, physically I really believe it’s made a difference.  So I’ve done that.  And then considering I’m a very logical person, I’ve also done energy healing and I actually work with an energy healer who’s based out of Marin.  I probably talk with him about once a month.  And I do lots of supplements.  I’ve really changed my diet.  I’ve gotten much healthier from a dietary perspective.

I’m not sure he necessarily believes in any of it but I don’t think he necessarily doesn't believe in any of it, you know?  I think he’s sort of middle of the road when it comes to that.  So yeah, you know, for me it’s, at a minimum, at a minimum it’s a good placebo but I know, I really do believe in my gut that it’s really helped.\",\n",

So I will tell you that I’ve lost 40 pounds that I obviously needed to lose because right now I’m sort of at the right weight, so I obviously was not eating well and was not exercising as much as I did before the cancer.

And then --  Oh, my sister called me and she was pretty shaken and then she got onto the Internet and called back and said that 5% survival thing is not correct.

And he informed me that he’s one of the --  You know, he said, “First of all, I wouldn't say these thing; you’re a very close friend.”  He said, “But I am one of the premier surgeons for this stuff in the country.”  He said, “That comes from all the experience I’ve had doing it.”  So he said, “I’ll do and have completed surgeries that other very good doctors wouldn't do or don’t have the experience to do.”  So that’s why Silver just had that envelope.  She’s sending everything to him.  And I’ve talked to Dr. Tempero about it and she said, “Yeah, well you can send him anything you want.”  And if he tells me that he believes that he can operate on this and take this tumor out, where they’re not too sure about it here, I’ll go down and have – I’ll go with him.  ‘Cause I know his values and I know who he is, so…\",\n",

And then I came over here initially for a second opinion and just felt far more comfortable here and my husband and I talked about it and, you know, at that point in time, you know, you’re hoping that you’re going to go through this once and done, you know.  So I, you know, even though it was a little farther than what would have been closer to home, this is my life, you know, so we opted to kind of make the journey.  And I also looked at it and said you know, for us, what we call the journey is like maybe two hours in the car, whereas there’s people that come from San Diego by plane or wherever to come here.  So I felt actually pretty blessed that it was only two hours.  And then once, it’s kind of like once you’re immersed in it, you know, sometimes, with having the recurrences and things now, sometimes you go oh, geez, it’d be nice if it was just 30 minutes instead of two hours or whatever.  But I think that the quality of care, the relationship with my doctors and, you know, it still, it makes it worth doing it.  The only thing I’m concerned about is if at some point down the road my health declines to the point where it’s not a comfortable trip, you know, how we’ll work that out.  But I know I can’t be the first person that this ever happened to so I’m sure there’s mechanisms in place.',\n",
       " 'Correct.',\n",
       " \"I had felt a little lump on my chest wall and I went to my regular primary care physician and asked him about it.  And he said, “Oh, that’s nothing.  Don’t worry about it.”  And, you know, to his credit, he gave me the slip for a routine mammogram.  But, you know, when he says, “Aw, it’s nothing; don’t worry about it,” you don’t quite make it your priority to go in.  And so I think that was like end of September and I think in December I was going to have a break in school so I thought well I’ll take care of it then.  And I had asked my husband if he felt anything and he didn't and sometimes I couldn't feel it.  And I know or knew that I had dense breast tissue so I thought well okay, maybe it’s – you know, defer to the doctor, you know.  He looks at this all the time.  But then around Thanksgiving my husband said to me, “Is this the area that you were concerned about?”  And I said, “Yeah.”  And he says, “You’d better get in now,” so then kind of accelerated the process of getting the mammogram.  And then one of my friends is an OB-GYN doc over here and I had called her and she said, “Go back, see your doctor, tell him that you want an ultrasound too.”  And I didn't realize that adding the ultrasound, you know, raised it to diagnostic but, you know, the day that I went in for the mammogram and the ultrasound, then that was the day the radiologist came in and told me that she found three masses in my right breast.  And then they referred me, my primary care physician referred me to a surgeon over in Contra Costa County and I liked her, but then she sent me --  Because she pretty much figured out almost the same plan that I went through here, that, you know, that it was a slam dunk.  It was going to be a mastectomy.  She was concerned that it would probably be, you know, require a skin graft too to close it.  And then she also thought that it would probably have to be the new [..?..] chemotherapy so she sent me to a plastic surgeon and then she also sent me to, I think it’s Epic(?) Care Chemo Center out in Antioch.  And I liked the plastic surgeon.  His office seemed very efficient, very, you know, on top of what they were going to do.  He was the first one that, you know, he really said, “Yeah, you know, this will require a skin graft, and so I would be standing by during surgery.”  But then when I got out to the chemo facility, that’s where it all kind of fell apart for me.  You know, I walked in and they gave me papers to fill out.  Well first – and the papers were photocopy papers.  The copies were so poor that I couldn't even read them, so, you know, you’re already stressed to the max and then they’re giving you these things you have to kind of read and fill out.  Then some gal came out to get me to take me in and honest to God, I swear she was on drugs.  You know, she comes in, she takes me, you know, she snaps my picture and doesn't tell me why she’s doing it, she’s talking to herself the whole time she’s doing all these things, and then she puts my husband and I in a room and leaves.  The doctor came in and he seemed competent, but – and I told him – because I tend to be a little outspoken – you know, “You need to do something about your photocopies out there.  They really suck.”  And then he was going to want a PET scan, which made sense, and I guess they took care of all of that there.  And then he was talking about putting a port in and I know there’s another term for that, which I’m not quite sure what it was.  But then they sent me out to the front desk afterwards and I said, “Well okay, now he wants me to make an appointment for a PET scan and can you tell me what this” – whatever that term was.  And they just kind of start shouting, “Does anybody know what a” – you know, and then they’re all debating back and forth.  And I said, “Well wait a minute.  Maybe I figured it out.”  I said, “Is that a port?”  And they said, “Oh, yeah, that’s what it is.”  Okay, fine.  Then they tell me that they can’t schedule a PET scan right then and there because their machine is down and the parts are on back order from Israel.  And so, you know, when we walked out of there I said to my husband, I go, “If my life depends on those people, I’m gone.”  So, you know, unfortunately by then I already had an appointment.  I was going to come over here for one of the same-day assessment type things.  But since I’d already had a biopsy and things by that point in time, I just brought my records over.  And when Dr. Ewing came in and looked at things, she said to me, “Now are you here for a second opinion or for treatment?”  And I said, “Initially a second opinion and then I’ll decide from there.”  And then she went out and looked at things.  She made a phone call to John Muir because they hadn't given her some of the information on, you know, the type of tumor.  And then she right away got Dr. Malisko and brought Dr. Malisko in so, you know, that first appointment, I mean, she introduced me to Dr. Malisko, you know, she told me what she thought, and then that’s when my husband and I talked about it and said, you know, this is just a way better feeling.  You know, we go through what we have to go through and then hopefully we’re done.\",\n",
       " 'Uh-huh.',\n",
       " 'No, I never had any --  Everything’s been done here, after those first initial appointments over there.  The only thing that was done in my community was the diagnosis and then the biopsy. ',\n",
       " 'Yeah, in Walnut Creek.',\n",
       " \"Well I’m a little strange.  My husband wasn't my husband at the time.  He had proposed but we were going to enjoy the process of planning our wedding.  So he lived in Antioch, I lived in Rio Vista, but, you know, we were back and forth between the two houses so Walnut – and there’s basically no medical care in Rio Vista.  So my choice was to either go Fairfield or like UC Davis or something, or go to Contra Costa.\",\n",
       " 'No.  I mean, even that’s about, you know, 45 minutes.  The biggest difference is you don’t have the Bay Bridge in the equation.  You know, that’s the thing that can kill you.',\n",
       " 'In the shower.',\n",
       " \"Well I had always kind of done self-exams but, like I said, I have very dense breast tissue.  And see, I had had a routine mammogram done at age 35 and at that point in time they had some concern because it came back with a lot of calcifications in it.  And my OB-GYN had called and said, “Well we want to do a biopsy” at that point in time.  Well my husband at the time is a physician and he said, “No, we’re not just going in there and cutting willy-nilly,” you know.  So he did some research and at that time he took me down to Stanford and I saw a doctor down there.  And he said, “I don’t really think we need to go in and biopsy right now.  I think we can do some spot magnifications and follow it every six months.”  And then the determination that they made at the time was that it was just calcifications and, you know, at some they would absorb and at other times they would appear.  So that’s why I just kind of figured well maybe this was like that, when my doctor then said, “No, that’s nothing to worry about.”  And sometimes I couldn't find it.  And I mean, the funny thing is, they told me that the masses were at 2, 6 and 12 o’clock and none of those were where I felt the bump.  So was it or wasn't it, you know?  Hard to tell.\",\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " 'No, no history at all but my OB-GYN at the time just thought that that was the age you should start at.',\n",
       " 'Yeah, so we did.  And he was in practice down in Redwood City.',\n",
       " 'Correct.',\n",
       " 'Yeah.  Basically what I did is, you know, I grew up back in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, moved to California and Belmont and when I was in – I had just finished my freshman year in high school, lived there and then when I married my husband, moved to Marin.  And then after we got divorced, I moved out to Rio Vista.',\n",
       " 'Correct.  Yeah.  And I mean, this whole thing has been really strange for me because I’ve been healthy as a horse.  I mean, I had my tonsils out when I was 4 years old and that was the only time I was ever in the hospital.  You know, other than I had three bouts of pneumonia, other than that, I mean, nothing and then just here we go. ',\n",
       " 'Yeah.  So it’s been, for me, just getting into the medical --  You know, it’s like I tell people now, my pretty much full time job is staying alive and that’s been a real life-changer for me.',\n",
       " 'I came here for that first meeting with Dr. Ewing January 31st of ’09.  By, I think it was February 26th, they started chemo.  Or actually, it might have been like February 16th, somewhere in there.  And then I was on chemo until May 26th.  That’s why I’m thinking maybe it started on the 16th.  Then they gave me a month off and then they radiated the right side and then they gave me another month off and I got married in that month.  And then they did the surgery on June, I think it was June – no, I’m sorry – September 25th, I think it was, 25th, 27th or something.  And all along, they kept, you know, like before they started chemo they did the PET scan, they did an MRI, you know, and they had, on that MRI they had seen a spot on my left breast that they were concerned about.  But, you know, when they went in – they did the MRI guided biopsy and they actually did three spots – they were negative.  So then I think they did another one in June and everything was fine.  Then they were going to do one more before I went to surgery in September, so I came in the beginning of September, had those done, and then they saw another spot on the left that they were concerned about.  So they biopsied that and that one came back positive.  So, you know, but Dr. Ewing had said, “Well we found this one so quickly and so early that I feel like we could do a lumpectomy on this side, if you wanted, followed by radiation.”  And Nick and I talked about it and said, “You know, where there’s this much smoke, there’s got to be fire.”  So my vote was just do the bilateral mastectomy and be done with it, hopefully, you know.  So that’s what we opted to do.',\n",
       " \"Right.  So instead of just focusing on the right, then we were bilateral.  And then after that, they put me on the hormonal drug because all my margins came back clean.  I mean, everything was looking really positive, and they put me on Femara, so that was the hormone drug.  And I was on that for like nine months and everything seemed to be doing fine.  You know, they’d scan me.  And then you know, Nick and I were just kind of starting to feel comfortable again, you know, and it was Memorial Day weekend of 2009 when we decided okay, we’ll go ahead --  You know, 'cause we wanted to get one of the two houses into rental and we didn't know which one, where we wanted to live.  So I told him well if he wanted me to live in his house, we needed to update it 'cause I wasn't going to live in all those(?) grounds(?).  So we had just torn down wallpaper and everything else over the weekend.  He went to work Tuesday morning and I was still doing the, you know, Vitamin E on the scars and all that.  Well all of a sudden I felt a bump over on my left chest wall and, you know, I tried not to freak.  So then, you know, when he came home I said, “Do you think these could be like mosquito bites or something that maybe” – you know, when you’re working you never know.  And he said, “No, I don’t think so.”  So I sent Dr. Malisko and Dr. Ewing an email and said, you know, “I’m supposed to see you guys the beginning of July but this is what I found.  Is this something that can wait until then or what?”  And they both sent me an email back, “No, we need to see you now.”  So I came in and what it was was a recurrence on the chest wall on the left side.  So then they took me off the Femara because obviously that wasn't working, and put me on an oral chemo drug, Xeloda, and then that seemed -- you know, they were kind of using the nodules over here as a barometer, and then the nodules seemed to shrink and the PET scans were good, so that was fine.  And then about February of this year, so that’s February 2011, it seemed like the nodules were kind of starting to get bigger again.  And so --  Oh, I forgot to mention too, then when they, when these nodules came up, the PET scan after that, then they saw a lesion on my liver too so they started watching that also.  And the Xeloda seemed to be keeping that in check.  So then when these nodules started looking like they were getting bigger, they decided that now was the time to radiate the left chest wall, so they did that and another PET scan.  And then they saw that the lesion in the liver had grown some.  And in the interim, they had sent me to Dr. Korvara(?) to see if I would be a candidate for radiofrequency ablation on the liver but – I just have great luck all the way down the line – it just happens to be in a space – it’s by the biliary tree so he’s not real comfortable doing that.  And so, you know, they radiated this and then they decided well they needed to put me back on chemo, and then that’s when I ended up on the Gemcitabine.  So that’s the journey.\",\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " 'Well I think a lot of it, I mean, number one, having been married to a physician, that helps.  I mean, one of the things that my ex-husband, John, had told me was that medicine is a business.  And he said, “You are the consumer and so you need to a), participate and take control in your own healthcare.”  And a lot of things he told me – that was a good one.',\n",
       " 'No, we don’t speak.',\n",
       " \"Yeah, yeah, and I mean, he was a brilliant diagnostician, a brilliant physician, just a lousy husband but, you know, can’t hold everything against him.  But anyway, you know, so one of the things --  And of course the first thing that you tend to want to do is go to the Internet and look at things.  And Dr. Malisko had told me early on not to do that.  Because she said --  The part I left out is, what I was diagnosed with ultimately was inflammatory breast cancer, which is one of the more aggressive forms.  And she said, “If you go out and you read everything about inflammatory breast cancer, it’ll just – you’ll just freak.”  And, you know, the other thing that I understand is what you see on the Internet too in terms of medicine, for the most part, it’s boilerplate.  You know, if you go according to the textbook, this is what will happen, this is what will happen, this is what will happen.  But I’m smart enough to know that every individual reacts differently and there’s a lot of different things that come together.  So of course initially I didn't listen to her and I went out and I read one or two things and she was absolutely right.  It just freaked me out.  So then I thought that’s it.  I’m not going to do anymore.  Now my sister has gone and, you know, occasionally she’ll tell me, “Well they have this new thing out there on inflammatory breast cancer now where it’s a virus.  So if they can just figure out what” –  And I just say, “Okay, yeah, fine,” you know, because again, even if that’s what it is, what’s that do for me right now, you know?  So all I can deal with is my here and now, you know.  And so --  And then the other thing I did, one of my instructors at school, her sister was a nurse navigator at a cancer center up in Oregon and Laurel had put me in contact with her early on.  And, you know, Kate was a real big help to me because to me, she was kind of the neutral person.  You know, like I could come here and Dr. Malisko could tell me things and then I could go back to Kate and say, “Well what do you think?  Does this make sense?”  And one of the things that she kept impressing upon me all along was that she thought that I was just getting excellent care here.  She was very impressed with the way all my doctors were working together.  And she, on top of my own feelings, gave me a sense that I was in good hands.  I mean, I can remember one time in June of ’09 where I had Dr. Malisko, Dr. Ewing and Dr. Falvo(?) all in a room with me at the same time because they were trying to determine whether they wanted to do the radiation on the right side before the surgery because that’s not the normal course.  And I mean, my head was spinning as they’re going back and forth doing all these things, but where else do you go and you get all three?  I mean, usually it’s a phone call, “Well I called Dr. so and so,” you know.  So again, that gave me a sense that they all were communicating about what was going on.  And so, you know, Kate was a big source of help.  I didn't go out and join support groups because again, I don’t like to deal with the emotion of it all and I mean, I’m more than willing to help.  I’m better at helping people than having people help me.  You know, like I’ve had a lot of my friends call me.  In fact I got an email yesterday from my daughter-in-law’s sister.  “Well I met a gal down here in Atascadero that has breast cancer and she’s had a mastectomy and is having a lot of hormonal issues.  Can I have her friend you and talk to you because you have such a positive attitude about things?”  And so, you know, I’m more than happy to do that but I’m not real comfortable going and sitting in a group and talking about, you know, the touchy-feely stuff.  That’s not me, you know.  So Kate was helpful.  You know, I have met, like I met one gal in the supermarket that, you know, I thought – you know, I heard her talking about breast cancer and she was dressed in a lot of pink stuff.  And then I got over to another aisle and she was reading the nutritional values on some things.  I said, “Yeah, boy, those can be confusing.”  And we started talking.  It turned out that she is a 20-year breast cancer survivor.  She had actually come over here and hers had metastasized to her bone.  She had come over here and the doctor over here had told her “you have a year to live” and she said, “Nope.  Don’t do that.”  Well and then as it turns out, when I went home and I’m telling my husband about this great gal that I met, he and her husband had coached Little League baseball years before so he knew her.  And so she’s been, you know, somebody that I will talk to.  And I’ve done some Relay for Life things with her and then Oakland A’s Breast Cancer Days.  So I just kind of pick and choose.  And then, you know, I listen to what Dr. Malisko tells me.  I put a lot of value in what Dr. Falvo tells me.  Dr. Ewing since the surgery and first follow-up, she’s pretty much been out of the loop.  But, you know, I think that both Dr. Falvo and Dr. Malisko, they listen to me too.  And one of the things that I’ve told them that’s important to me is quality of life.  You know, Dr. Malisko has another patient that I knew that hung in for like ten years and, you know, she’s like legend around here, and she was a friend of a mutual friend of ours.  But I don't know that I could do that.  I mean, I --  And that’s what I was just talking to Dr. Falvo.  To me, you know, the first thing you hope for is the cure, which is what I had hoped for when I went through the initial thing, 'cause that’s what I kept saying to Nick, is, “If we can get through this and I come out on the other side and I’m fine, that’s okay.”  You know, it’s in a rearview mirror and you move on.  But now that that isn’t the case and I keep getting more bumps, you know, it’s like I just said to Dr. Falvo.  “I can’t hope for the cure anymore,” I said, “but what I can kind of hope for is the miracle drug combination or something that will put it into a remission state.  And maybe all these little pop-ups will stop popping up, you know, and I go along.”  If that’s the case and my quality of life is still good while I’m trying to find that, then we’re good.  But if it’s to the point where the inevitable is going to happen and I’m just going to go through hell between now and then, you know, what’s really the point there?  So I have to trust them and I think they both understand me well enough that if I reach that point they’ll tell me.  And that’s like the way that Dr. Falvo just put it to me, and she said, “You know, the things that are happening right now, we can deal with those.”  And she said, “But, you know, if it got to the point where we’re saying to you, ‘well we could do this for you or this, but we really don’t think it’s going to work,’” well then I have to trust their best judgment because they’re the professionals, you know.  And if I go out and I read the Internet and I read all sorts of textbooks and talk to 10,000, it’s not going to change that.  And I firmly believe that they want to keep me going and they want me to have that quality of life that I want.  So, you know, that’s I guess kind of how I make my decisions and, you know, I try to --  You know, Nick, he pretty well understands that too, you know, but it’s like I said to Dr. Falvo, I’m the oldest in my family and I pretty much raised my parents, so, you know, it means something to me to be there for my family.  But if I get to the point where I’m a burden to them and it’s, you know, even though they wouldn't come out and say it, you know, I don’t want that either.  So you know, you just have to kind of keep kind of checking in and see where you are between the goal posts, you know?\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, my sister is up in Calaveras County.  She lives up in a little town called Mountain Ranch.  Then I have a brother that’s actually a half-brother.  He’s in Dixon.

But Nick, we’ve got two boys there, we have five grandkids, one on the way, and I have a niece and nephew so yeah, it’s kind of --  But my biggest thing from my side of the family is my sister and my brother, you know, 'cause I’m kind of like the broker that tries to keep the relationship going.  And then Nick, I know he’ll do okay but he just lost or we lost his dad in May and his mom is 90.  So, you know, we’re kind of dealing with that too, so, you know, I kind of want to be around to support him and help out as much as I can.\",\n",
       " 'Right.',\n",
       " 'Right, to say I did it.',\n",
       " 'Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.',\n",
       " 'I kind of told them.',\n",
       " \"Yeah.  I mean, you know, like what I just told you I just got done talking about with Dr. Falvo.  And I’ve told Dr. Malisko that in the past.  In fact when she switched me to the Gemcitabine, I said to her, “Okay, if I do nothing, how long do you think?”  And she said, “Well” – and I mean, I know that you can’t give a hard, fast whatever.  But she said, “I’d say maybe nine months.”  I said, well, you know, it’s sort of like yeah, you don’t want to hear that.  Then I said, “Well what about if I do the Gemcita(?)?”  And she said, “Well, I think that even if we got the bare minimum out of every drug that we could use, I’d say two to three years.  And if we get longer out of some, five years.”  So, you know, that sounds better and if I’m not having too much of an issue with the chemo, then that makes sense.  So like she started me with the Gemcitabine.  You know, one of the things that she said that tells me that she’s cognizant of things is like she said, “Well you won’t lose your hair with this one.  You know, it may thin but you won’t lose it.”  And it has and she’s right there.  But, you know, and it’s like I told her.  I said, “You know, the first time when I lost my hair it was really traumatic 'cause it was down the middle of my back and I’d cut it and donated it.  But now it’s just a more practical thing.  You know, what I learned from losing my hair is that if it’s cold out, you get colder and if it’s hot out, even if you’re wearing a wig, you’re hotter.  So the hair is not as much a vanity point anymore as it is a practicality point, you know.”  So she kind of gets that.  And then like even going back to 2008 or 9 when we kept asking all year, you know, give us a window in time where we can get married and we’re going to go do this.  Well one of the things that happened in ’08, I got laid off in April of ’08 and thank God I had COBRA coverage.  But that was going to run out in October of ’09, so if Nick and I weren't married, I had no medical coverage.  And so --  And he still kind of --  Our wedding had been planned for July 25th but when I was diagnosed we put everything on hold.  And then, you know, so all along we kept asking them.  So finally then, like I guess it was after the radiation stuff, they said, “Okay, you’ve got a window in time here now if you want to go get married.”  And so then --  And like Dr. Falvo, she was so great 'cause she said, “Well you know, your breasts changed a little bit from the radiation.  So if you feel like your bra isn’t fitting right for your dress, go see them in the gift shop because they can give you the stuff that’ll make it fit.”  And then I saw Dr. Malisko.  You know, she looked at Nick and I and she said, “Well you know, I don’t see a medical reason why you need to get married right now, you know, if you don’t want to.”  And we said, “Well we see one 'cause we need the medical insurance.”  And she said, “Oh, okay.”  So it didn't hit us ‘til later on when I was walking up the street.  I said, “Nick, you know, it’s really pretty funny.  I get a choice.  Most brides only have to decide what they’re going to wear.  I get to decide do I want to get married with my boobs or my hair, you know, it’s one of the two”, you know.  So even the little things that they kind of think about that maybe even I don’t think about tells me that they’re kind of in tune not only with the medical aspect of things but the emotional and whatever, which, you know, again, I know from my ex-husband part of that is because your university medical setting is different than your private practice medical setting.  And, I mean, the push is on to see so many patients in private practice versus yeah, you want to see them in the university setting but I think there’s more an emphasis on the quality of care 'cause they take the time if they need to do it.  And I mean, like Dr. Foster, who did my skin graft, he invariably runs three to four hours behind.  And you’d see people out there, you know, you’re waiting, and they’re fuming.  And I’d say, “Hey, but if he does a good job, isn’t it worth it?”  And he takes, once he gets to you, he takes the time.  I mean, like I went into surgery at 4 o’clock in the afternoon; didn't come out ‘til 11:30 at night, and he was there at the end from about 9:30 to 11:30 and did a beautiful job on the skin graft, I mean, if you can do a beautiful job on that.  I mean, those are I think the things that you’ve got to look at along the way.\",\n",
       " \"It’s worked out – I mean, I’ve been really blessed on that because my COBRA coverage handled everything up to the point that Nick and I got married and then as soon as I went on his plan, they’ve covered everything since.  And Nick is an electrician, a union electrician, and their medical coverage is great.  I mean, it’s a PPO so we’re good there.  You know, the only thing that he worries about a little bit is like because it’s a group policy --  It’s weird.  Like Nick is 62.  If he had retired before age 62, roughly I guess what our medical coverage costs is about $1100 or something a month.  Because what the union does, is it doesn't matter if you’re one person, you’re two people or you’re a family of six.  It’s the same.  And so like if he had retired even as a single man before age 62, he would've had to pay $1100 a month for medical coverage.  Well the way it works is they take 120 of his hours per month and that’s what covers the medical coverage.  And anything over and above that you can bank up to a six-month bank.  So if he’s out of work a little bit, then, you know, we’re okay there.  He’s been out of work a little bit more this year with the economy the way it is, but fortunately he’s really good so they keep him going.  But every time that happens, he worries about, you know, “I need to get back to work because I don’t want the hours in the bank to go down.”\",\n",
       " \"But so far, I mean, that’s a worry that we haven't had.\",\n",
       " 'Not really.  But I think I got a little lucky because, like I said, my friend at COB GYN in the Women’s Healthcare Center, she called to make the appointments for me.  And so I think that’s why I got in as quickly as I did.  You know, it’s who you know sometimes, not what you know.',\n",
       " 'I think so, yeah.  But then like my friend that I had referred, she got in fairly quick and she just happened to get Dr. Ewing and Dr. Malisko too, so it worked out really well.',\n",
       " \"Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I was raised – my parents were both raised in the Salvation Army and so I was initially dedicated in the Salvation Army.  And then, you know, we’ve gone to church my whole life.  My mom was a church organist, my dad sang in the choir and, you know, like Sundays I was at church from like 9:30 in the morning until 2, 3 in the afternoon.  And then I think after I moved out I went through a period – plus I worked weekends a lot where I didn't go to church as much, but since ’96, you know, I’ve been pretty much back and going.  You know, it’s kind of like that book, “Why Do Bad Things Happen to Good People?” or something, you know, and so you kind of look and go, okay, I know I’ve broken a few of the commandments along the way but in the grand scheme of things, if you’re a Christian and if you accept Jesus, then your sins are forgiven and you’re okay.  So okay, we’ve done that.  We’re good there.  And I’ve also always been a firm believer that you can read the bible and if you want to take point A and I want to take point B, we can both come up with scriptures or whatever in the bible to support our theory, you know, so I don’t think there is a right and there isn’t a wrong.  And I think the whole thing is, that’s why they call it faith.  You just kind of have to have faith.  So for me, what I look at is that I can do everything that I think I need to do, but God’s got a plan.  I may not know what it is, I may not understand it, I may not like it, but he’s got a plan and I just have to have faith in that.  But having said that, I also think about that old joke where they say, you know, the flood waters were coming and the guy was sitting on the top of the roof and, you know, a boat comes by and they tell the guy to jump in.  And he goes, “No, no, that’s okay.”  A helicopter comes by.  “Come on, get in, you know, we’ll take you to dry land.”  “No, no.”  Well the guy ends up drowning and he goes to heaven and he says, “I don’t understand, God.  You know, I was a good guy.  How could you let me die here?”  And God says, “Well I sent a boat, I sent a helicopter,” you know, and so that’s kind of what I say, is that I can’t put this all on God.  I mean, he’s got a plan but he kind of gives me decisions to make along the way and I don't know if there’s a right one or a wrong one because ultimately I’m going to come out, you know, with his plan.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I’ve seen – pardon my French – but horses’ assess that lived to be, you know – and then some really sweet people that don’t.  So you’ve just got to figure that there’s something else out there.\",\n",
       " 'No, no, because I think that I believe that God gave me intelligence and that I’m to use that intelligence to make decisions that are prudent.  Like the fellow that came Friday when I think we were upstairs and I told you I’d send the [..?..].',\n",
       " \"Well that’s the minister, actually, that married me and my first husband and then me and Nick and it’s his daughter that’s the OB-GYN doc over here.  But I mean, and he’s always told me that --  He told me sometimes I have faulty theology because I think of things one way, but he’s also always said like sometimes for him that he feels like he shouldn't be a minister because he’s too earthy.  And so he was at the church, after he got out of the army he was at the church that I go to now in Rio Vista, and then when he retired, we now have a lady pastor there.  Well they’re about like this, you know.  Jerry’s very earthy, Ella Ray is very spiritual and I mean, in her world everything that happens God, you know, micromanaged it.  In Jerry’s, you know, God’s too busy on Sunday to help the football players and things of that nature.  So in my case I think, you know, it’s just having the faith, which isn’t always easy, that he’s got a plan and I think that he’s put things in my path as I’ve gone along this that have helped me.  Like the first day that I went for chemo, I mean, I was a basket case.  I mean, I was sitting there.  I felt like my hair would fall out any minute and even though I’d had it cut.  Well the lady across the chair from me kept smiling at me.  And I think she could tell I was on the verge of tears, you know.  And then she said to me, “You have beautiful hair.”  And I go, “Oh, but I don't know for how long.”  And then we started talking.  Well it turns out that she lives in the little town in Calaveras County where my sister built her house, and then we became friends and talked for a while and she helped me through a period there.  Then like the lady that I met in the grocery store.  You know, so I think that – you know, I believe that God sends me the support that I need when I need it but, you know, he’s not up there micromanaging everything.  And then I don’t understand it but I have the faith that there is a life after this and I’m in no hurry to get there but I’ve just got to believe, you know, and take it on faith that there is something beyond this.  It’s like my dad said before he died.  [Pause, crying]  He was looking forward to seeing his dad and his mom and his sister, so it’s been almost two years and sometimes I can talk about him and not cry and then other times I can’t.  But, you know, and he went --  The last seven years of his life were tough and I think I kind of use him and my mom as kind of my inspiration, because they both handled it really well.  My mom passed away from COPD and my dad had a series of strokes and each one that he had was more debilitating to him.  And that was one of the hardest things for me when I was diagnosed, was how much do I tell him and how much do I not.  And I think – my sister-in-law and I were talking about that yesterday, that I think – she said she thought the last year of his life was the toughest and said in some ways I blame myself for that because I wasn’t there as much for him.  And, you know, as a family we kept him at home the whole time and my brother and sister-in-law and the kids lived in the same house with him.  But I would go over and – you know, I handled the financial, the medical, the relief care and then once I was diagnosed and going through chemo I couldn't go over as much.  And so I think that that took a toll on him too.  But then again, I have to say well maybe that was just his time, you know, and again, like God maybe put him through that so I could see how he handled it so that I can try and incorporate some of that into the way I handle this.\",\n",
       " 'Well I’m not sure.',\n",
       " \"No.  Well I, you know, when they gave me the diagnosis, you know, I went over and I told him that I might not be around as much because I had an abnormal mammogram and I wasn't sure what was going to be happening with it.  Well the next day my brother called me and said, “I don't know what you said to dad” – and my brother and I had talked about it, should I tell him or not and, you know, Jeff said, “Yeah.  You should probably”, you know.  So he says to me, “I don't know what you told dad but he’s refusing to get out of bed.  He says it’s time for him to die because you’re going to die.”  And then my aunt, his sister, had died of breast cancer.  So then he was getting confused and said, “I’ve got to go to the hospital and this is Jeanie.”  So I told Jeff, I said, “Don’t worry about it.  I’ll be over and I’ll clear it all up.”  So I went over and I said to him, “Dad, you know, remember when you got sick we talked about how you weren't going to give up?  We don’t even know anything for sure on me yet.  So let’s just make a deal.  If you don’t give up, I won’t give up.”  And he said okay.  And then like when I cut my hair, when I first cut it short, I went to show him.  I said, “I figured after 40 years it was time, you know, to do something different.”  And he goes, “Eh, it looks okay.”  And then when I bought the wig, I tried to buy a wig that kind of went along with it and I thought I had pulled all that off.  Well then his physical therapist had told me, she said, “He knows more than you think he does.  Because I said to him, ‘Hey, Walt, what do you think of Sharon’s new haircut?’  And he goes, ‘That’s not her hair.’”  You know, 'cause his cognitive abilities were still pretty much there.  And then my sister-in-law again, we were talking about this yesterday, and she says, “No, I think he knew more than he let on,” you know.  And one of the things I had said to him all along was he had to keep going 'cause he had to walk me down the aisle at my wedding.  And so then when it came time for us to get married, his health had deteriorated and I said, “Okay, dad, do you want to walk me down the aisle, do you want me to roll you down the aisle with me or do you want to just wait up front?”  And he said, “Well I’ll just wait up front.”  And we said okay.  And then I had told Jerry, my minister friend, I said, you know, “I’m too old for anybody to really give me away and plus, I don’t think my dad could remember all that.  But just incorporate him somehow,” you know.  And so Jerry kind of went through a big thing and then he said, “What do you say, Walt?”  And my dad, like just right on cue, goes, “Yep, let’s go.”  But that was pretty much my dad’s last public appearance.  But, you know, what he did, because my dad just had this ability to just kind of roll with things and I think that’s been a lot of what I’ve looked at, is his example.\",\n",
       " 'Probably too much.',\n",
       " 'Oh, no problem.  I told you I talk.',\n",
       " \"I can’t really think of anything.  I mean, it’s --  You know, I mean, I think this whole thing, it’s a journey, I mean, it’s definitely a journey.  And it’s like Dr. Falvo just said to me, you know, you have ups and downs.  And that’s why I’ve tried to learn not to get too high or too low.  You know, there’s some days I have where it’s like just take me out back and shoot me, you know, let it be over with.  And you always hear about people talking about getting their affairs in order.  I mean, I’m trying to do that to the extent that I can, but – and I mean, maybe that’s one of the bargains I keep trying to make with God, is okay, let me get this all set up before, you know, and sometimes I get mad at myself because I look at it and say well basically, now you’ve had almost three years.  Everything should be in order.  But, you know, things happen along the way.  It’s like when my dad passed away, things financially came to me that, you know, I didn't think that I was going to have to deal with but, you know, he left me with certain instructions to make sure that certain things get done for the grandkids and this and that.  And you try to get other people to, you know, help you, like my brother.  And like one of the things that my dad wanted, for example, was money to go into my niece and nephew, his grandkids, and I’ve been trying to get my brother to sit down with me.  And he doesn't like to talk about these kinds of things, you know, but to figure out what’s the best thing.  You know, you’ve got the 529s, the [..?..], you know, and I’m trying to make, from my perspective, do I think these kids will go to college, what do I think is going to go on?  You know, so like I sat down yesterday and finally I told my sister-in-law, I said, “Look, I’ve got to get these things under control and done.  This is what I’m thinking is the best thing.  You guys look at it and let me know but I need to do it this year,” and I said, “’cause I want to do it for tax reasons and just to know that it’s done.”  So when I kick myself and say you still don’t have your affairs in order in three years, you also have to look at the ancillary things because with my personality, I tend to take care of other people first.  And so like, you know, I’ve been handling my dad’s stuff and when Nick’s father died, I mean, his mother is like 90 years old, married 66 and a half years, doesn't even know how to balance a checkbook, and Nick is not good – he hates paperwork.  So I’ve kind of had to handle all that stuff too.  So I mean, those are things that I think, you know, maybe for people it’s like how do you put your affairs in order, you know?  I mean, 'cause I keep thinking oh, geez, you know.  And then like for us, we’re trying to combine.  We still haven't gotten into one house.  We still have both houses out there, you know.  So I guess it’s like life kind of gets in the way of your putting your affairs in order, plus you’re trying to deal with the medical things that come up as you’re going along.  So I don't know.\",\n",
       " \"Yes.  You know, it’s like every time I shred paper and say okay, I’ve got all these forms, you know, like I finally decide I don’t need my car insurance policies from 2004, you know, shred them.  Any piece of paper I shred and get out of the house, it’s something that somebody doesn't have to look at down the road and make a decision about, you know.  But that’s the only other thing that I can think of in your sphere.\",\n",

       " \"Oh, okay.  Well it was kind of an odd visit because they were overbooked for Friday and so I came in on Thursday morning but I was having an echocardiogram and a CT scan in the afternoon.  So normally we would've talked about those two tests on Friday, but because we had the exam before I had the test, it was just kind of a, “How are you feeling?” and then doing kind of a quick examination and then kind of getting caught up on personal things, 'cause Lynne had left and then is coming back like on a part-time basis.  So we were just kind of catching up on, you know, how her ankle was, how – you know.  So we talked about a lot of personal stuff too.\",\n",

       " 'Oh, just about everything.',\n",
       " 'Yeah.',\n",
       " 'They’re supposed to call me or email me with the results.  But I have appointments with my doctor, either Malesko or one of the nurse practitioners, every six weeks.  So I see them a lot.  That’s why we talk about a lot of personal stuff, because after a while there’s really nothing else to talk about.',\n",
       " \"Oh, I’m doing great.  I don't know about --  Well you’ll see my history.  I had cancer the first time in 1994, I had a recurrence in 2003 so I’ve been here at UCSF since 2003 'cause the first time around it was in my lymph nodes.  So I knew there was a pretty good chance that it would come back.  And I live in the Central Valley in Turlock near Modesto and I had gone to an oncologist there and I just didn't feel like I got tremendous care.  I mean, I got competent care, I think, but not great and I knew that when it came back I’d want to come here.  So that’s why I’ve been --  I can’t remember what your question was now.  But anyway, so I’ve been coming to UCSF since 2003.\",\n",
       " \"For one thing, I didn't feel like my doctor could pick me out of a lineup if he had to.  He was male and I think when you have a cancer that is predominantly female, I think it’s wise to have a female doctor 'cause I think they’re more caring and more sympathetic.  You know, like I was 34 when I had cancer the first time and so needless to say, the chemotherapy threw off my cycle and towards the end I felt like I was kind of having a nervous breakdown.  I needed some estrogen in my system or something, and he was just kind of like, “Yeah, well that’s just what you have to do.  Deal with it.”  Very cavalier about the whole thing.  But he’s never had a period, he’s never seen what it’s like when your cycle goes crazy, you know.  And I think too, the first time I went through cancer I was, like I said, 34.  I was teaching full time at that time.  And so I just kind of pushed on through and I don’t think I really ever dealt with it beyond like okay, what do I have to do?  I have the lumpectomy, I have to do radiation, chemo.  Okay, I’ll do that.  But I don’t think I dealt with things psychologically.  And so I think at the end, when my hormones were all whacked out and I think that I did have a lot of anxiety, he just was not very helpful or cooperative.  And so when it came back a second time, then a friend of a friend had been coming here to UCSF and she had had Dr. Malesko.  And from my first meeting with her it was like oh, my God, I’ve found the right place, you know, this is someone who’s super supportive, and also pointed out to me that my doctor in Modesto had given me the wrong mediation for the reoccurrence, which does not really instill confidence either.\",\n",
       " \"Well whatever he gave me – and I can’t remember exactly what it was called – he assumed that I was in menopause 'cause I had lost my period for about three months.  But it had come back.  I had told him this.  It should've been written down in the file, but apparently it didn't happen.  So when I had a reoccurrence, it was like, “Oh, let’s put you on this and go have a mastectomy and call me when you’re ready.”  That was kind of the attitude.  It was just very kind of obnoxious.  Anyway, so when I came here, Dr. Malesko’s kind of like, “Well are you in menopause?”  And I was like, “No.”  And she’s like, “Well then this medication would not have been helpful at all.”  And so then she switched me over and I’ve been here ever since pretty much.\",\n",
       " 'Like when I was diagnosed or at the end?',\n",
       " \"Okay.  Well I felt a lump actually more on my chest.  Well it was very low on the breast.  And like I said, I was 34 so at that point, you know, they’re not giving you mammograms or anything.  But it was just, it was like a marble size and it was really hard and it just kind of gave me the heebie-jeebies.  So I contacted my general practitioner, we had a mammogram done, and what was really weird about that was, because of where it was, kind of on my chest wall, it wouldn't have shown up on a normal mammogram, so they had to really try to – and you could just see a little portion of the tumor on there.  And so – and then I had a biopsy at that point and then they said yes, that it was cancer.  And so because it was so low and not really so much in the breast, then I had a lumpectomy and went through chemotherapy, I believe, for three months, which was the deadly, awful, like almost kills you kind of chemo that they used to do in the olden days where you lose your hair and you’re sick as a dog and the whole thing.  And then I had radiation.  That was over the summer.  I think that was also like almost three months, and then three more months of chemo.  And then at that point they felt like they’d done everything they could at that point and it didn't…and they were doing blood tests that supposedly showed that it wasn't coming back.\",\n",

       " 'Is this my oncologist or my --',\n",
       " 'Yeah, just like a general oncology practice, so he saw every kind of cancer, which I realized fairly early on is not really where you want to be.  I believe now, having gone through this a couple times, you need to be with specialists.  ‘Cause he saw all different kinds of cancers and so I don’t think he was maybe as cutting edge as he should have been when it came to my particular kind of breast cancer.',\n",
       " \"Well first of all, when he gave me the wrong medication.  That was a pretty good indication.  But I had kind of thought before that he was not --  Well for one thing, when he would --  Okay, I was a teacher and so I always had tons of grading.  And so I would come to my appointment with just a briefcase full of stuff 'cause I knew I would wait an hour to two hours before I would see him.  That’s the first thing, which I think is very rude.  My time’s valuable too and I think he was always overly scheduled so I don’t think he really had time to sit down and look at my reports and everything.  So anyway, when he would come in, he would usually sit down and read the report in front of me, which always made me crazy because as a teacher, if I did that to a parent, I would have been crucified.  But it was okay for him to sit there and be what I concerned unprepared to meet with me.  And then I felt like it was just always kind of rote, like, “Oh, well you have breast cancer so this is what we’re going to do for you.”  I don’t think it was ever personalized or --  ‘Cause I feel like with Malesko, like they’re looking at my scans, they’re looking at everything, and I think a lot of times – I know they’re following certain protocols but I also feel like they’re taking into consideration like, “Oh, well you have this symptom or this,” whereas I don’t think he did that.  I think every breast cancer patient pretty much got the same care and the same choices.\",\n",
       " \"Right, yeah, a long time ago.  Well, because it was so low on the breast and because I was still relatively young --  And my feeling was that if you had a mastectomy, that would be a much more invasive surgery.  And I was all about getting this done quickly, moving on to my life and, you know, not having to deal with that.  And my surgeon, which is rather shocking -- he was an older man -- he actually recommended the lumpectomy over the mastectomy.  And doctors after that that knew him were surprised because normally he was, “Just take the breast and move on.”  But in this case – and it was mainly because of its location.  And like I said, I didn't want anything terribly invasive so I was like, yeah, that’s okay.\",\n",
       " \"Oh, so in 2003 my oncologist in Modesto, I was meeting with him and I had had this really weird episode -- it was around January or so – where one night – I think I had a cold or something and had been coughing really hard, and it’s like all of a sudden I couldn't breathe.  Like all my bronchial tubes just closed down.  And I have had a little bit of asthma but never like this before, and it was like, you know --  So my roommate took me to the hospital and this whole big ugly thing.  Anyway, so – and very scary 'cause you can’t breathe and --\",\n",
       " \"Yeah.  So anyway, so when I saw him the next time, which I think was like February or March or something, my next appointment, they asked, “Well is there anything different that’s happened?”  So I happened to mention that.  And so – this is another reason why I didn't have a lot of confidence.  So he’s looking through my file going, “Well haven't we done any chest X-rays on you?”  I said, “No.”  So in like nine years we never had a chest X-ray, which I would think you’d have like a little checklist that you would kind of keep track of this stuff.  Apparently not.  So then he was like, “Well that’s kind of strange.  You should've had a chest X-ray just to kind of check.”  So anyway, when they did the chest X-ray they saw that the cancer had metastasized to my lung, and so at that point then, that’s when he said, “Well, you know, pretty much you need to go and talk to a surgeon and then we’ll deal with you there.”  And then that’s when I came to UCSF.\",\n",
       " 'Oh, yeah.',\n",
       " 'Well that and then just like, like I said, I had not been happy for a long time but I kept thinking well, it’s fine, he’s in town, it’s easy.  And this was the doctor that my surgeon had suggested.  I mean, he’s supposedly the best in Modesto and all this kind of stuff.  But no, it was time to move on.  So it was in my lung and then within I think --  So what’s been happening is about every year or so the medication stops working, then we move on to something else.  So for instance, it was in my lung and then I had another reoccurrence in my breast.  And at that point they wanted to see what the chemical makeup of it is.  So like some of my cancer is estrogen positive, some of it’s progesterone positive, some of it’s a combination, some of it’s HER-2 positive, some is not.  So it’s this really very kind of conglomeration.  So they wanted to know like what was the difference between what was in my breast and what was in my lung.  Well when they went in to check on the lung, then they found out that the cancer was covering my lung so the pleurae(?) is completely covered with cancer right now.  And since then, it’s also move into my liver.',\n",
       " 'Yes.',\n",
       " 'No, it’s a friend of my brother and sister-in-law.  And so when my cancer came back and I was saying I think I need to go someplace else, I’m not happy with my care here --  And I also felt like too, and I’d said all along, if and when I have a reoccurrence I’m going to a research hospital where I feel like it’s more cutting edge, where I’m not getting something that somebody read in a maga-, you know, their journal like five years ago.  So anyway, so I believe my brother or sister-in law – I mean, I knew this woman but we’re not close friends, we’re not in contact with each other, so anyway, I believe that I --  It seems like one of them called her or I called her, got the information and then I just called up here and then set up an appointment and brought all my records in.',\n",
       " 'No, no.',\n",
       " \"No, I know.  When I think about this, it’s like --  Well and I guess I am kind of lackadaisical when it comes to that.  No, it’s just like I just knew that I wanted to come either to Stanford or UCSF, 'cause those are the ones that I’d heard good things about kind of through the network.  And then, like I said, then this friend of my brother’s.  Yeah, I mean, I talked about it with my best friend, you know.  I think I probably talked about it with my sister-in-law.\",\n",
       " \"Well I guess because I realized early on that they’re going to specialize in --  You know, 'cause like Dr. Malesko, she just does breast cancer, whereas my oncologist was doing everything.  And that’s why, the more I thought about that --  I don’t even know why I came to that conclusion but -- that that’s the place.  I wanted to be with a specialist as opposed to somebody who saw everybody.\",\n",
       " \"I didn't really care.  I just wanted people who were as up to date on treatment and drugs as they could possibly be, rather than, like I said, someone who’s kind of like operating in the dark.\",\n",
       " 'Basically it was whatever the doctor suggested.  In the beginning I always saw Malesko and now I think because I’m more stable, I see nurse practitioners.  But it would be like – let’s say, for instance, now I have like the incidence with the cancer in my lung.  So then she would suggest a certain kind of drug.  She would usually give me a couple of choices and say, “Well this one might be better because of this, this, this,” but then the negatives too.  But most of the time, like if she would suggest one and she would think that one was better, I would usually go with that, mainly because I, you know, really trust her and the nurse practitioners.  They seem to really know.  And she would sit there and explain things even to the point of like chemical breakdowns, which, I don’t need all that really, but she’d want you to know.  And then like I said, it would usually last for a year and then I would have another recurrence or the cancer would start to grow, wherever it was, and then at that point then we would talk about a new drug or whatever they wanted to try next.  And like I said, they usually lasted about a year.  Sometimes I would have more side effects with some than others but for the most part, I’ve really been very healthy except for the Xeloda, which is the one I’m on now.  When I first started taking that one, that was pretty bad.',\n",
       " 'Yeah.',\n",
       " \"Well I’m trying to think the milligrams they had me on a day.  2,000 a day maybe?  It’s a really, really high dose 'cause they want to see what you can tolerate.  And so I really had a bad reaction.  I had the mouth sores, I had the diarrhea, the nausea, the whole thing, you know.  At one point I was passing out, I think because I was so dehydrated.  And so after just a couple days on that drug, I’m calling here.  I’d gone out of town, of course, and so I’m calling in, saying, “I think I need to stop doing this drug.  I don't know what’s going on,” duh, duh, duh.  And so they said that was fine.  And so now we’ve reduced it to less than half of what I took before and now I still have hand/foot syndrome but that seems to be the only real side effect that I have.  And so I’ve been on it now for three years and it’s gone really well.\",\n",
       " 'Oh, I felt really good about them.  Yeah.  I feel like, you know, what they’re putting me on --  You know, when I talk to other people who have cancer --  I don’t go to a --  I went for a while to a support group when I had my recurrence and then I found out that I was everyone’s worst nightmare.  No one wants to think that it’s coming back, no one wants to think that they’ll have cancer forever, which is basically what I’m looking at.  I just have to think of it as like diabetes.  It’s just going to be a treatable disease and that’ll be fine.  But people don’t want to hear that when they’re in their group.  But anyway, when you would be in a group like that, and people start talking about treatment and stuff like that, but, “Oh, yeah, I’ve been on that, I’ve been on that.”  So it’s like everyone has kind of been on a lot of the same drugs and had a lot of the same experiences as far as side effects.',\n",
       " \"Well I think that because I’ve already dealt with all that, when you haven't had the recurrence or you haven’t had it metastasize, that’s such a big “oh”, like oh, dear God, don’t let that happen.  And I remember when I had my recurrence, I basically thought it was a death sentence, I mean, I really did.  But then you realize that no, it really isn’t, that there’s so many drugs now, there’s so many other options.  I mean, I know people die of breast cancer and I’m very lucky but I think for the most part, once it happens to you, and you kind of get used to the idea, it’s not that bad but for others it is.\",\n",
       " \"It probably happened within a couple of months of my reoccurrence, because it wasn't a death sentence.  I mean, I wasn't having to do the really deadly chemotherapy and I wasn't having to do lots of things and I still felt good.  And so that was fine.  Also too, I should probably mention that after I had cancer the first time and I was a teacher, so things don’t really seem to hit me until like summer, when I have some downtime, you know.  You can get rested and then all of a sudden like all the fear and the anxiety and depression, that’s when it’ll hit you, in the summer.  And so I started going to a therapist that summer because I felt like I needed to --  Obviously something was terribly, terribly wrong and once again, when I had my reoccurrence I went back to her again and saw her for several months.  And I think maybe during that time, just kind of talking it out --  I mean, I have friends that I talk to about this and stuff but it’s different with a therapist, as you know.  ‘Cause I think the first time I was kind of in denial about the whole thing and was just like let’s just get it through, power on, duh, duh, duh.  And the second time I was like okay, I don’t want to go through that whole anxiety/depression thing again so, you know, am I okay?  And I felt like it was different this time and that I was more accepting of the whole thing.  Also too, I’d been teaching a lot longer.  The first time I’d only been teaching like four years so I was still really gung-ho and I loved my job and I loved what I did, so I worked through the whole thing.\",\n",
       " \"They were 13.  I taught seventh grade, [..?..] world history.  So I loved what I did.  And so I just had the trash can near the door, you know, and I sat on a stool and I taught with no hair and the whole thing.  The next time around I’d been teaching about 13 or 14 years and now I’m, you know, I’m not as in love with my job and I realized that my job is super stressful and it’s actually making me worse rather than better.  So I think I had a different attitude about that too.  So I actually thought about cancer the second time around as kind of like a gift because I knew it would get me out of teaching, a super stressful job.  So Malesko will tell you I used to come in and say, “Is it bad enough now?  Can you write me the disability thing?  Is it bad enough now?”  And I told her too, I said, “I can have 20 teachers outside that door that will tell you that it’s too stressful and it’s killing me.”  And it wasn't until it was covering my pleurae that I finally was able to go out on disability.  So yeah, so my attitude the first time was kind of like let’s just get through this, you know, and I would get on with my life.  And the second time it was kind of like oh, well now I don’t have to teach until I’m 62.  I can leave now and get my life back.  And I really feel like cancer has given me my life back 'cause I have time, which most people my age do not have.  At 47, to be able to kind of walk away, is really a wonderful thing.  I know it sounds bizarre but it really is.  Yeah.\",\n",
       " \"No.  Well it’s really funny 'cause it’s like when I walked away from teaching in the beginning, I really thought I was going to die in a year, I mean, 'cause --  I mean, the surgeon says to my family something like, “Oh, she was just full of cancer so I sent her back up.”  Oh, well, you know, that’s probably not the thing to tell people.  So I basically felt like, you know, that I had maybe a year to live.  Malesko would never give me numbers.  She would never say --  Like there was that whole thing in there about like do you have a 50% chance or are you going to be dead in a year?  She would never, ever say that, and I decided over --  In the beginning I wanted numbers.  I wanted to know like do I have a year to live, 'cause I need to know.  ‘Cause if so, you know, I’m going to make different choices than if I think I have ten years.  But I think that by not giving a person numbers or whatever, it’s kind of like it’s up to you.  And so now I’ve decided I’m going to live to be 80, which I think would be a normal lifespan for me.  So that’s been different.  And I totally forgot my point.  Anyway, so you can just continue.\",\n",
       " \"Oh, yeah, I do work.  I was going to say so when I got done, I just said, you know, no, I don’t want to go back to that.  And I am a very religious person and I do feel like that God kind of like --  Well the joke is, it’s like he couldn't get me to leave teaching any other way except to give me cancer.  That’s the joke I tell people.  But I think it’s true, that it was kind of like, you know, it was hard for me to leave.  I still enjoyed working with students but I hated all the other crap.  But anyway, so when I left I kind of felt like, you know, that door’s closed, that part of my life is over, and I enjoyed it and it’s what I always wanted to do.  Well once I got to be a certain age.  But anyway, so that was great.  So I never felt a need to go back and do any like substitute teaching.  I didn't want to do that.  I did tutor one of my nephews probably for like that first year and then this last summer, I have a cousin who has a pie company and so I’ve worked farmer’s markets for him on Saturdays.  Not every Saturday but I’ve done that a lot this summer, so that’s been really the first paying job I’ve had since I left and once again, nothing to do with teaching.\",\n",

       " \"I consider it a vacation when I come up here.  I lived in San Francisco for almost three years after graduate school and I would love to still live here.  It’s just I realized early on that I could not afford it, so I ended up moving back to the area where I grew up.  And I just didn't want to do my student teaching in San Francisco.  I’d heard lots of bad stories about that, that you get stuck at really awful schools.  And I was going to be teaching secondary so that means junior high and high schools, which elementary I think you can go almost anywhere and be okay but junior high and high schools, I didn't want to be there.  Anyway, so I moved back to the area and did my student teaching there.  So no, so for me, coming to San Francisco is yeah, like I’m always thinking about what restaurant I want to try.  I have a good friend that I often stay at her apartment.  So it’s great.  I love it.  And I guess at home it’s not really a problem at all.\",\n",

       " \"Yeah.  ‘Cause one time – it was the first time I was supposed to be in there and I had brought stacks of files and X-rays and all this stuff.  They had asked me to bring it in like a week earlier or whatever so she could kind of preview it before she met with me, which I liked that.  But then the day I was supposed to meet with her they were supposed to have it on the door and they didn't.  And so, you know, she walks in, and she’s starting to talk and then she wants to have certain X-rays or something to put up and they’re not there.  So she’s like, “Excuse me for just a moment.”  Have you met her, by the way?\",\n",
       " 'Okay.  “Excuse me for just a minute.”  And you could hear her go out in the hallway and go, “There’d better be that file on my door in the next” – you know, and she’s saying it in a nice way but like in a no nonsense, and I felt like she’s really an advocate for patients.  And I don’t think she has a lot of patience with bureaucracy and stupidity and I feel like she wants the best for her patients and she will go to the wall for you, if she has to, whereas I think some doctors, like I said, you’re just a number.  But she --  You know, I’ve met her, I’ve seen her in hallways and elevators and she always knows who I am, which I think is kind of incredible since she has so many patients.',\n",
       " 'I can’t think of anything, no.',\n",
       " \"You know, I have just had such a positive experience.  The only slightly negative experience I could – it’s never been at Mt. Zion.  Mt. Zion has always been fabulous.  I’ve never had a problem with anything.  Parnassus, however, has been a different story.  I haven't always – I don’t like going over there, first of all, 'cause there I think you’re more of a number and you’re more of a cog in the wheel and they don’t know who you are.  And I had an experience one time where I had to go over there for either a CT scan or MRI, something like that, and it was just this crazy chaotic thing, where lots of people were coming and going, and the woman that was checking me in was very stressed out, I think, and frustrated and not very helpful or whatever.  So anyway, so I’m filling out paperwork.  This is before they had you show your I.D. and so she’s just kind of rushing me through.  Okay, whatever, I don’t care.  I mean, I do this all the time, but I usually do it here.  But that day I had to do it over there.  So anyway, when I sit down and I’m reading my book and for some unknown reason I happened to look at my wristband, well that’s not my name so she’d given me the wrong wristband and the whole thing.  So then I go back up there and it’s like, she’s just kind of like, “Yeah, okay,” you know.  It wasn't even like, “I’m so sorry.”  I mean, that could have been a big deal potentially.  So I wasn't very impressed with them.  And I’ve also had surgery over there and they were very nice but I like Mt. Zion much better and I like my experiences here and yeah.  And Berry Street has also been fabulous.  They’re really good too.  Berry Street.\",\n",

       " \"Okay.  They believe that a nicotine patch would stop hand/foot syndrome and so they asked me if I wanted to be in part of that 'cause I was on Xeloda.  I was like, “Oh, sure.”  But the whole thing with that was your hand/foot syndrome had to get to a certain point to be severe enough and mine never really got to that point.  And then by the time it was to that point, then it was like I was too far out in my treatment to be part of the study so that one didn't work out.  And then there was one other time where there was another study.  I can’t remember what it was about, but there was some reason why that wouldn't work for me too.  So I have been offered twice, that I know of.\",\n",
       " 'Yeah.  Probably my best friend, who’s also my roommate.  My sister-in-law is probably another one.  I have a friend who has also been through breast cancer.  She’s older than I am but it’s only been one time for her.  And her and I on occasion will talk a little bit.  You know, with breast cancer patients pretty much once you know someone has had it, you kind of become instant, you’ve kind of bonded instantly.  So there’s a few other people that, you know, that I have talked to probably once or twice but it’s not a regular kind of thing.  And a lot of times it seems to me, because I’m the one who’s had the reoccurrence and I’ve been dealing with it off and on for 17 years, and I’m usually the veteran, and so usually it’s like people are talking to me more about like what happened to me so that they can kind of compare their situation.  It’s not so much me needing to use them as a sounding board, if that makes sense.',\n",
       " 'Yeah, so it’s usually the other way around.  And I do get phone calls from people, kind of like, “Hi, I’m so and so and I’ve heard you have breast cancer”.',\n",

Yeah, it’ll be like a friend or a coworker, you know, in the past will know somebody and they’ll say, “Well call her and she can give you” – and my advice is always to go to a big teaching hospital and get someone who’s a specialist.  That’s my – yeah, and I can usually sympathize.  And I think it does make people feel better, that I am still so healthy and it’s been so long and that usually makes them feel better too.\",\n",
       " \"I don’t feel like I need a lot right now, 'cause I’m feeling really, really good.  I think that when you start feeling bad or sick or, you know, or it’s like in a growing phase, then I think that you tend to reach out more.  And then I think like too, my parents are getting older and they both have issues.  My dad had prostate cancer a couple years ago, my mom has Parkinson’s.  I mean, they have all their own issues and so I don’t really feel the need to reach out to them 'cause, you know, 'cause mothers, you know, they’re crazy when it comes to stuff.  So anyway, so I think sometimes she thinks I don’t tell her the whole thing, which there have been times when I haven't because I just don’t want to go there.  And my sister lives far away and she’s a lot younger than I am, and I’m not married so I don’t reach out in that way.\",\n",
       " 'I don’t really think so.  I think it’s pretty much that she’s kind of a sounding board, and she comes with me to my appointments and my sister-in-law does too, oftentimes, when I meet with Malesko.  ‘Cause we find that if there’s three of us there, then usually – and one of them is usually taking notes, we find that sometimes we hear slightly different things or get slightly different information.  So we find that that’s very helpful.  So usually we’re all kind of on the same page.  We kind of like listen to the pros and cons, and I don’t think we’ve ever been at a place where we’ve like disagreed or someone has thought oh, maybe that’s not a good idea or whatever.  I think we’re all pretty much in sync.',\n",
       " 'I’m trying to think.  There was a – oh, gosh, what is it called?  They have a person here that will come with you into the appointments and they’ll either tape it or --  Do you know what that’s called?',\n",
       " \"I think that’s what it is.  And so my first couple of meetings with Malesko and stuff that person was there and they were tape-recording.  And at that point, I think my parents wanted to come.  Anyway, that was the first and last time they came.  And I just thought that made so much sense to have somebody sitting there and recording and then transcribing what you’re talking about and the whole thing.  Because you’re talking about very technical things and I was a history teacher.  I was not a science teacher.  So when she gets into all this chemical stuff or chemistry, I can only follow so far and so it’s nice to have someone there.  So I think from that then – and then when I had the reoccurrence, my sister-in-law and brother said to me, they said, you know, “We would like to be more involved and if it’s okay with you, can one of us come to the appointments?”  And I was like, “That’s fine.”  And then – and my sister-in-law was usually the one that was more free so she would come and she’s really good at taking notes.  So she was the best one.  And then over time we found that if you had all three of us, especially when we’re driving home – it’s like 2 hours in the car – we could kind of be debriefing and talking and, “Did you hear this?  Did you hear that?” or whatever, you know, and kind of back and forth and just kind of making sure we were all understanding everything.  And so that became a really important part.  And I’d say probably in the last year my sister-in-law hasn't come quite so much because there really hasn't been any changes in the last couple years, but we still try to get all three of us together, if we can.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, probably a little bit 'cause we all just kind of talk about it.  But pretty much, you know, we kind of just go with what they suggest or what we think is --  A lot of times they’ll give us two options so we try to go with the one that seems like the lesser of the two evils, but the one that’s the more, I don’t want to say “aggressive” because I don’t necessarily feel like it’s necessarily the most aggressive, but whatever we think is --  They usually kind of let us know which one they think is best.  They’re not saying like, “This is the one you need to do,” but they’ll say, “There’s this choice and this choice,” and usually one is obviously better than the other, at least to us it seems like it’s obvious.\",\n",

And on occasion like, you know, I mean, I do read articles and my friend, my best friend, Renee, will sometimes – you know, she’s more into like looking things up on the Internet and she’ll then give me information or stuff like that.  My mom was into that for a while and then finally, thank God, gave that up.  But they will pass on information.

So I don’t like to think that I’m in denial but, you know, I guess I feel like I’m feeling good and I feel like everything is stable.

Right now I think it’s like 550 so I feel like I’m just getting by with nothing.  And then of course I have a deductible and then out-of-pocket and all that kind of stuff.  You know, I firmly believe that we all need to have socialized healthcare but I don’t think that’s any big surprise for anyone who’s going through this.  My insurance is actually pretty good compared to a lot of people’s, but there’s still, you know, a certain amount of out-of-pocket and then medication and then I do a lot of things on my own that are not covered, like I do acupuncture and my acupuncturist also does Chinese herbs so I do that as well.  I get a massage once a month 'cause I think that’s important, and then I also see a chiropractor.  And those things really aren’t covered.  So there’s a lot of things that I do that aren’t.  Yeah.  So yeah, I’m doing fine financially but like I love to travel.  When I was a teacher I would always take off for like a month or so in the summer and go to Spain or go to Peru or whatever.  Well I don’t get to do that anymore.  So even though like my quality of life I don’t think --  I mean, I own my own house, I mean, things are fine, but, you know, there’s not a lot of money for extras, shall we say.\",\n",
       " \"No.  No, and like I said, and I’ve added on 'cause I think those things are important.\",\n",
       " \"Well let’s see, my best friend, Renee, her sister-in-law – it’s always friends of a friend – she grew up in Berkeley and she knew about this one doctor who is an acupuncturist.  He does Chinese medicine and he’s also a pharmacist.  So the thing that’s beautiful about him is like if I come in and I say I’m on Xeloda, he’ll be like, “Oh, well then” duh, duh.  So he knows what my side effects are and all that kind of stuff.  And I feel like he does --  He actually caters – or I shouldn't say “caters”, but he designs the Chinese herbs that he’s giving you to what he found that day.  So it’s always a little different.  They taste a little different every single time.  Whereas I went to an acupuncturist/herbalist here at UCSF, who I think did a good job, but I got the same herbs every single time.  I didn't feel like there was any like, you know, personalizing it like he does.  Anyway, so that’s how I learned about him, was through her.  My mom had given me an article about massage and all that kind of stuff when I had cancer the first time, because I think everyone who knows a teacher realizes that they need to have a massage at least once a month, maybe even more.  So she gave me this article and there was this women in Modesto and she did massage.  She does a lot of – she does different kinds, and so I started going to her when I had cancer the first time and then I’ve just continued on since then.  When I was a teacher I think I went twice a month 'cause I had more money and I was more stressed out than I am now.  And then my mom and dad had also gone to this chiropractor who does a very gentle form of chiropractics.  It’s not the bone-crunching kind of thing, and I was kind of dealing with carpal tunnel and all those kinds of things from being a teacher and so I started going to him.  And I realized early on doing the massage and the chiropractics I had less, you know, like pain in my back and my shoulders and my carpal tunnel was better and all that kind of stuff.  So I’ve been doing that then for 17 years.\",\n",

Stanford.  And we also get the second opinion, you know, that one in San Francisco office.

So we say [..?..] in two weeks?  You know, “Well we need some time.”  So yeah.

I decided because Sherlock Holmes injected cocaine that I would try that when I was able to.

       " \"Well the progression was in 1998 I was working for a sound company, in fact it was my big break to announce a rodeo.  I was going to get to announce the Folsom Rodeo.  And I showed up and I could barely talk.  The boss sent me to the hospital, doc put tongue depressor on me, checked the blood, admitted me.  Hepatitis C.  So then I went through Interferon, tried it four times, wasn't successful, just wouldn't work.  This, that and the other thing and I left Folsom and moved up to where I live now in Tule Lake, which is on the Oregon border.  And I’d, over the past years I had always taken my treatment at U.C. Davis, the medical facility in Sacramento, because that’s where I lived and it worked out.  That’s where I got referred and they had one of the greatest gastroenterologists and he retired, which is unfortunate, 'cause he ran the transplant program and he always told me, “Well if you need a transplant, don’t worry.”  Well as soon as he retired, that went away.  So when they determined that I had tumors, which was March of last year, they immediately put me on the transplant list, which meant coming to UCSF.  To further make things more fun, I already had a gastroenterologist in Klamath Falls and they had just got him.  I mean, the hospital had been rebuilt and they were searching for staff.  They’d been looking for four years.  This guy’s real good.  He discovered that I was allergic to wheat, you know, gluten, I have the gluten allergy, Celiac disease, one more thing just to throw in for the fun.  And so at one point, I had three gastroenterologists.  And it was pretty simple, no-brainer, because UCD had no financial assistance, whereas Klamath, even though it’s poor in the middle of nowhere, total financial assistance and of course here I get total financial assistance.  So I still owe them, UCD, some money, which I’m paying off, but at the moment they’re kind of out of the loop and I just went from Dr. Yow(?) to Dr. Kelly, so we’ll see what happens next and hopefully the Nexavar(?) will add a few years to my life and that’s about it.\",\n",
       " 'Yeah.',\n",
       " \"Well what happened was they immediately booked me back into UCD and they did what they call RF ablation.  I don't know.  They basically stick a microwave antenna in there and they just burn them.  And that worked, so they killed those three.  But then a couple more popped up, so that’s when the Tumor Board made the decision to have chemotherapy done while I was on the transplant list and they signed me up to – they call it a tase(?) for some reason but it’s just another poison.  They stick a camera in your liver and then they go after it and they got all those cancers.  So at that point I was still on the transplant list.  Well as of February, the CAT scan showed an inoperable tumor or it’s what they call in the portal vein, they call it “invasive”.  So sorry, can’t give a new liver to someone who might have real cancer instead of just a few little chunks here and there.  So, because of that, now I’m on the Nexavar program.  Interestingly enough, back in March, when I was about to get microwaved, my nurse then at the time – I had just learned about Nexavar – and she said, “Oh, we’ve got someone here that’s doing real well on it.”  She goes, “But realistically, they’re not going to give that to you except as a last resort.”  She said, “It’s real expensive.”  And there you go.  Post-transplant drugs are about two thou a month; this is eight thou a month, so I hope it works.\",\n",

I like to do that anyhow to see my parents and my friends that are still here.  So I’m just dealing with it as best as I can, which isn’t too bad compared to --  When I look at --  I mean, I’ve seen people, I’ve been in the groups with people who, if they didn't get a liver in the next three days, they’re ordering a casket.  That’s the reality of that.  So you kind of, you go --  And then, you know, you go, “Yeah, I’ve got liver cancer,” and they’re like, “Wow.

And finally his wife convinced him to go to the doctor and the doctor said, “You have two weeks to live.  Get your affairs in order.”  And he died two weeks later.

AIDS was already known and they had an inkling that that was happening with the hepatitis.  But once they solidified their knowledge of it, it was like --  I’ve got one friend who’s infected over 100 patients 'cause he’s a member of the Ten Gallon Club and most of those people he’s infected were people getting heart transplants.

Once the FDA’s approved it, the manufacturers always put up a website, do the FAQ.  It’s instantly in Wikipedia.  A lot of people disrespect that.  I, myself, think it’s great.  And you Google around and what normally took a week to research now takes a couple hours.  So apparently with the Nexavar, it was originally developed for kidney cancers and they just happened to find that it worked for liver cancers so pretty lucky there.  I know there’s a way big story behind that but I don’t look for the back story.  I just look for the facts right now.  I mean, I’m sure I would be interested in that as a researcher.  But, for example – and this is just 'cause of the industry I worked in – they always love to talk about how they discovered microwave ovens, and a guy had a radar tube sitting there and he left his candy bar in front of it and it melted.  Oh, we can sell that.  That’ll work.  But, you know, that’s pseudo legend and pseudo truth.  I mean, it really happened but, you know, do you need to know that?  No, it’s just interesting stuff.  So I wouldn't --  Oh, well, you know, I’ll spend a lot of time on the computer looking to see what happened to so and so, who used to play with so and so.  But other than that, you know, back stories, no, just the facts, just the fact’s man, stick to the facts.\",\n",

It shrinks them and it doesn't allow any new tumors to form.  Those people are going to live a little bit longer.  Now on their FAQ – and this is kind of dumb because they really can’t say this, but they’re already saying that patients live an average of 44% longer.  Well that’s a meaningless fact.  It’s a statistic that doesn't have any bearing on the individual because they’re just compiling numbers and taking --  So does that mean that the guy lived or does that mean that it slowed the cancers instead of stopping them?  See, 'cause now that’s the other side of it.  It might not work at all, it might just really slow them down and it might kill them dead.  Naturally, I’m hoping it kills them dead.  Going back to the 44% figure, if it for most patients slows them down, then it’s kind of hard to say well – it’s like I told you before, that tumor could have sat in my body for ten years and then all of a sudden that last six months, that’s it.  So if we were to look at it on that level, let’s just say that I was going to live ten years without the Nexavar.  Then with the Nexavar, I’m going to live 15 years, according to their statistics.

They don’t want to make the older drugs that are hard to make that there’s no profit in, and even the generic companies aren’t interested in those, and some of that stuff’s necessary for a lot of people.  But anything that’s brand new and expensive, yeah, we want to get that on the market.  So no shortage of Nexavar.  I don’t have to worry about that.  And that happened with the Interferon.  The first big wave hit, before they invented the pegylated(?), and there was actually a shortage of about 8 months, where people had to wait.

Most people find one of the side effects to be depression, and that’s what happened when I tried the pegylated stuff.  Interestingly enough, the unpegylated, the first of which I had to shoot every two days – the pegylated is just once a week; you know, it’s like buffered; that’s what pegylated means.  Anyhow, I actually enjoyed it because it gave me megalomania and delusions of grandeur, and that’s like --  One in 5,000 get that reaction.  So when they told me that it’s not working, I’m, “What do you mean it’s not working?”  She goes, “Well it’s working.  It’s not – but we can tell.  If you didn't drop a log in the amount of the virus, then, you know, we’re done.  We’re not going to keep you on it for a year.”  But I honestly believe that they should've 'cause --  I mean, there’s no way you could experience this.  There’s no drug that gives you this feeling, but megalomania and delusions of grandeur are fun.  It’s a glorious, glorious insanity.  I mean, it’s so far the opposite of depression that I’m glad I got to experience it.  It’s just --  You know, I try to stay on an even keel.  No one wants to be that emotional, but it’s like I had the feeling of being Napoleon.  That I could do anything, you know, literally, and it was all the Interferon in my mind.\",\n",

It really means millimeter wave or radar but everyone calls them microwaves just 'cause, you know, that’s what they are.  That’s what they called them before the oven was invented then.  But people go, “Your microwave oven.  Can you fix it?”  “Well no, I can’t work on your microwave oven.  I could tear it apart and be dangerous.” \",\n",

And that was when my white blood cells got so low that --  What happened when I was diagnosed, what happens is your cirrhosis causes blood pressure and your veins in your esophagus burst.  So that’s what happened the first time.  The second time though, the Interferon knocked me so down, and I felt it when it happened.  I mean, I literally felt the blood vessel go.  Four days later, back in there getting them banded(?), getting, you know, saving my life again.  So then after that, then we tried another round of Interferon with another medication to keep my white cells up.  Same thing.  Didn't work.  Then we tried a fourth round of just Interferon by itself with no Rubiveron(?) because he wanted to see, in the event that --  At this point, new drugs were under development to take the place of the Rubiveron.  He just wanted to see how my body reacted to the Interferon by itself.  So after 12 weeks of that, we took some data and it wasn't even --  He wasn't trying to cure me.  We were just taking data.  And so we determined that yeah, I’m not a good candidate for Interferon treatment, unfortunately.  And hence, the gradual deterioration due to cirrhosis.\",\n",

So in March, when Dr. Bolis(?) said, “You know, I think we have a problem here,” and I said, “Oh, heptacellular(?) carcinoma?”, he looked at me like he wasn't really expecting me to have that in my vocabulary.  He said, “I’m sorry.  We’re going to have to do something about that.  You’re going on the transplant list right now.”  I wasn't surprised in the slightest.  I mean, not like I’m having a pessimistic outlook on life.  It’s just you know the odd – I mean, I was well researched at that point.\",\n",

The meld score is basically made up of three of your blood tests, one of which happens to be she’s slightly worried about.  And a normal average person like yourself, you have a meld of seven, you know.  That’s a normal count, normal platelets, normal white, red, bilirubin, all that.  So what happens is once they determine that you’re going to be --  Or you can talk your way into getting on the list, even if you have a good meld.  Just 'cause you’ve had Hepatitis C and you’ve got cirrhosis, you can get on the list.  As long as your meld though is under 31, you’re never going to get a liver.  What happens with someone who’s been diagnosed with cancer, is you’re on the list right now and they start you out at 22.  Forget about your blood tests.  We don’t care what those are.  You have a meld of 22, which means every three months your meld goes up three points automatically.  When it gets to 31, you’re getting a liver, son.  So in February, I was literally due.  They were talking in March, “We are going to get you a liver.  This is it.  You qualify.  You need a new liver.  This is it.  This is the program.”  As soon as that tumor popped up where they didn't like it, the program’s done and over.  And that was since May that I’d been in the transplant program here and it ended on Valentine’s Day.  Kind of a bummer.  On the other hand, there was a part of me in my, you know, without going into who I am and why I thought this, I never believed that I was going to get a new liver.  I mean, I wasn't hoping for this but there was just something that all along I thought man, I’m doing this and I just know it’s not going to happen and it didn't.  It was just one of those “I was telling the future again and I was right” kind of deals.  But I don't know.  Anyway, next question?\",\n",

Well then in going along with that, I’d be one of those people who, I’m perfectly willing to believe in God after I’m dead, if he’s there, 'cause the scientist in me has a real problem with organized religion.

I’m a direct blood line.  You could say that I am a witch by blood.  So just by – let’s just say that I’ve got notions that life possibly doesn't exactly end after death, even though the body ends.  I’m not necessarily going to say I believe in heaven but something once occurred to me, once happened, that made me believe that well, if she was dead and she did come and say goodbye to me, but her spirit didn't seem to be like – it was just more like, “Well see ya.  I’m out of here.”  But wherever she was going, I couldn't say, you know.  And that’s a real thing that happened to me.  I mean, to give you the specifics, this person died, she came to me in a dream, she said, “I’m dead.  See you around.  Loved you.”  Three days later her brother called me up and said, “Yeah, Melody passed away the other night” and I said, “I knew.”\",\n",

But as far as what happens afterwards, if there’s heaven -- I’m pretty sure Satan’s going to be afraid to let me in.  And I don't know if you’re familiar with the Jewish religion.  I’ve been told they don’t believe in hell at all.  So I know with Buddha, you’re on the reincarnation cycle.  Once again, you know, these guys are just all shooting in the dark.

And that’s why I said, I may ask you questions that may have nothing to do with what you’re asking me.  It’s just that I want to make sure that, for example, like I said, that if I told you I went out on Friday nights instead of going and having a couple beers, we shot some cocaine, that you wouldn't think I was evil because of that.

And you can’t lead a horse to water and make him read Webster’s, you know.  I mean, I could go on and on and on and I’ll shut up after this, but it’s horrifying to me when I see people that are in a religion and they don’t take their child to the doctor 'cause that’s how far they believe in the religion.

And finally the social worker I got here said, she goes, “Well basically, they’re just afraid that you might make an incorrect decision.”  And once again, that to me, it’s like God, I mean, the misinformation that’s supplied in that particular bias set, you know, it’s like the guy who’s dedicatedly going to drink himself to death, “I’m going to drink myself to death”.  Well when, you know?  It didn't seem to happen yesterday, obviously not happening tomorrow, but get a clue.  And my first gastroenterologist was open-minded enough to refer me to one of these pot doctors, and then my first gastroenterologist showed me an article where it’s proven that it inhibits cirrhosis in lab rats, a solvent induced cirrhosis.  And this is where I went round and round with the guys in Sacramento.  Because they were just like, I felt like they were being the pot Nazis they weren't looking at science.  But, now when I got to the transplant program, that’s a step up from there because there just aren’t enough livers to go around.  There’s no way around that.  So they make sets of rules that, it’s kind of like their god.  You can’t really argue with them, and it ain’t that big a deal.  And once again --  So they looked at me like, “Well you have to stop cannabis.”  Okay.  And once again, it’s like there’s so much misinformation.  They just acted like well this is going to ruin your life.  No, I didn't have any problem not drinking beer.  I don’t have any problem.  But then – and here’s the thing about me that, you know, without going too far into this, once again, you see that society lacks in discipline, you know, and competent people sometimes have to suffer society’s allowing incompetent people to set the bar.  So a lot of the stuff, like I was joking with the phlebotomist earlier --  I mean, I get a phlebotomist that appears to be not as able as I am.  I mean, I’m an easy draw and I can put a – you know, but I’m not allowed to do that.  You can’t be an unlicensed phlebotomist.  So this, that and the other thing is where I would be like bite my tongue and shut up because you know that this war is not even worth fighting.

I’m not sure if it was also called a lumpectomy at that time but I just remember it being called a partial mastectomy, where they took a pie-shaped wedge.  And from that surgery – that was in February of ’99 – from that surgery they saw that there were small buds throughout the breast.  So they went ahead and scheduled me for a mastectomy, so that was May of that year, 1999.  At the time, I had known, and I can’t remember which surgery – it had to have been the first surgery that told them it also had gone to the lymph nodes.  And so when it came time to do the mastectomy I asked the doctor to also remove my lymph nodes and he wouldn't do it.  And I was upset about that.  I remember I kept asking him several times if he would do that and he said it was not medically necessary.  He believed that chemo and radiation would take care of it.  So I did come up to UCSF at that time for a second opinion.  So that was my first time with Dr. Charles Dalbaum(?) and, you know, he agreed.  So that is the route we took.  So I went ahead and had that mastectomy and no lymph node removal.  \",\n",
       " 'So seven years after that, the cancer returned in the lymph nodes.  It was first found by my nurse practitioner at my gynecologist office in Modesto, and she felt a lump.  I never did feel it.  She did feel it and then suggested that I see a surgeon locally in Modesto.  Oh, and I forgot to say – I’m so sorry.  I’m jumping.',\n",
       " 'No worries.  It’s fine.',\n",
       " \"Back to before that happened, right after – when I had the surgery – this is making me nervous.  I’m sorry.  It just makes me nervous 'cause I --\",\n",
       " 'No, it’s fine.  It’s just that I’m going to stutter and things.',\n",
       " 'That’s okay.  Nobody hears it except for the researchers.',\n",
       " \"So anyway, right after that mastectomy or at the time I got the second opinion, I had to go around and get all of my lab reports and my MRIs, different things, and it was at one report that I had read that there were calcifications in the other breast that no one told me about.  They forgot to tell me that.  And they said they were all focused on this side because definitely there were, you know, it was definitely the cancer on this side.  This had not developed yet.  But from that, I decided to have a second mastectomy.  Now it ended up being a year later because I had the chemo --  Well after the mastectomy, I was getting reconstruction so they left the expander in and didn't put the implant in because they knew that I’d be getting radiation and that might compromise the implant.  So I had [..?..] -- [child screaming in background]  So that’s why I had to wait a year.  So for the six months of chemo, then the six weeks of radiation, then I went ahead and had the other side removed; then it was --  Oh, and then I had an expander put in the same, and then the goal was once this chest wall was stretched out, then it was going to be a surgery then to just take out the expanders and put in the implants.\",\n",
       " 'Well I got an infection from that surgery.  I got staph and pseudomonius(?) and so the plastic surgeon that had done this treated me for seven months with only oral antibiotics.  And so what would happen was I would inflame and then he’d give me an oral antibiotic and then for two weeks, you know, that would take care of it and then it would inflame again.  And it went like that for seven months.  So at the end of that time – I worked for a school district, and one of our school nurses was out at the site and I asked her if she knew anything about this; this is what I’d been going through.  And she said, “Do you mind showing me?  Do you mind letting me see?”  And I went into the restroom, showed her, she said, “Get your things; you’re coming with me,” and she took me out to our head Health Director at the district.  And she is the one that said, “You contact your doctor.  You insist to be hospitalized.  You could have a systemic infection.”  And so – and there’s a reason I’m telling you all these things.',\n",
       " 'This is really helpful.',\n",
       " 'Good.  Oh, I’m so glad.',\n",
       " 'Yeah, the level of detail is really, really useful.  Thank you.',\n",
       " \"Oh, I’m so glad.  I feel good about that.  So anyway, I did --  That doctor at that time, that plastic surgeon, was not very – I don't know what to say.  He blamed me.  He blamed me for the infection.  It was ridiculous.  He found out that it was staph and pseudomonius.  Our son had gotten married.  The surgery was in May.  Our son had gotten married July of that year.  And I wore a little padding in this side so I’d be even in my dress, mother of the groom, you know.  And so it was just a sports bra that I had been wearing and that was acceptable after surgery, but I had just put some stuffing, not hard stuffing but just soft kind of polyester type stuffing, you know, to be even.  That was the night that it was first red and inflamed.  And so when I called him the next day, he had me go to his office.  It had oozed the next day at the incision site.  And then that’s when he found out staph and pseudomonius.  But he said things to me like, “Well, you know, you should never have had any stuffing in that bra,” like it was something I did.  And it’s like no, this is staph and pseudomonius.  I mean, it’s nothing I did from the outside, but yet that was --  And then I was an HMO patient, you know, and he let me know that I was going to be his very last HMO patient.  He would never --  Oh, it was horrible.  He was horrible.  He just made me feel horrible.  \",\n",
       " \"And so anyway, so that was that period of time.  I ended up being hospitalized for five days on IV antibiotics.  When I was released a home healthcare nurse came for a month or five weeks and I had a PIK like and she would give me an hour of IV antibiotics and then the rest of the day, through the PIK line, I wore a canister, a hip pack or something, of constantly administrated antibiotics.  After that I saw an infectious disease control doctor and he suggested that I wait a year before doing anything.  Meanwhile, when I was off of all of those antibiotics, the hospital visit and then the home healthcare, I inflamed again.  And so this plastic surgeon said, “Well we’re going to have to take out that expander.”  So he took out the expander.  I had another surgery, took it out, washed everything and put in an implant on infected tissue.  Okay, that didn't last either.  It inflamed again.  And all this time on more antibiotics.  And he took me in his office when I had inflamed that last time and he said, “Well we have to remove the implant now.”  And he took me to a back room in his office and during the time that I had the PIK line for those four or five weeks and antibiotics, the PIK line came out and I had to have another one put in.  And just to put a PIK line in, everybody at the hospital suited up.  They had gowns, they had hats; they put three drapes over me, just to put a PIK line in.  They were so careful.  And it was wonderful.  \",\n",
       " \"Well here – now fast-forward, I’m in his office, he’s going to take out the implant.  He takes me to a back room, he gowns up; he puts on a mask and a hat and a white coat.  And I’m laying there on the table, didn't even know what he was going to do, and then he’s explaining as I’m in there that he’s taking it out there, you know.  And it’s like oh, my gosh, I didn't even know he was going to do it there and then.  He starts cutting me open and, you know, giving me lidocaine, cutting me open, and his office manager comes in the room, standing over me, breathing on me, no gown, no mask, no anything.  And I’m just praying, “Dear God, don’t let me get some other infection from her.”  She wasn't even suited up.  And so that was that.  \",\n",
       " \"Then I saw the infectious disease doctor, then I waited a year.  And I started to look into other options.  I didn't want to go back to that plastic surgeon any longer.  I was just done.  Nobody around our area seemed to want to touch work that was somebody else’s, that had begun with someone else.  I think they were afraid of me.  I couldn't get anyone to help.  Finally, it was actually one of the doctors’ wives that is a secretary in one of the offices in Manteca, in our town, she said, you know, “Go to a university, you should go to a university.”  And so that was good to know and I did.  I came and it was in 2002 and I met with Dr. Anthony and he was just wonderful, James Anthony.  And he was at that time with UCSF.  Now he’s on his own.  But he just was phenomenal.  He was the best of the best and did a great job with my reconstruction.  \",\n",
       " \"So then seven years after that first diagnosis, this is when it came back to the lymph nodes.  And so it was the nurse practitioner at my gynecologist’s office that found the lump, sent me to a surgeon in Modesto, and all this time my oncologist was in Stockton, Dr. Medi(?) in Stockton.  But what happened then is when I went to the surgeon in Modesto, she said, you know, “Well we’re going to do an ultrasound.”  So they did an ultrasound.  She says, “You know, I just think it’s an inflamed or an infected lymph node and let’s just check it again in four months.”  And so I agreed to that.  So in that four months nothing had changed; everything, you know, was the same.  She never saw a growth to it.  And she said, “Well we can just go in and take that out.  Let’s just remove it.”  And I said, “Well if you don’t think that this is anything serious, then” --  I was just starting a new job at that time and I just said, “I’d rather wait, you know, if we can because I’m just now starting a new job.  I just don’t want to take off immediately when I begin.”  And she said, “Oh, no problem.  We’ll check it again in four months.”  So in the next four months, checked again and no change, and she said, “Well you know, I don’t even feel anything.”  Well this lasted for a year.  It was, I think, an entire year.  I think it was from January to January.  And so, you know, the checking and then twice she had said she wanted to just go ahead and do the surgery and I just, you know, I wasn't comfortable with that.  I just said, “If you don’t think anything’s wrong, then I’d like to just put that off if we can until we think something’s really changed.”  And she said, “Well okay, I’m going to have you come back in another” –  So she tracked me every four months for a year.\",\n",
       " \"And at the end of that time, right before my appointment, somebody called me from her office and said that, “Dr. Eve would like you to have an MRI.”  And I thought it was a mistake, because I forgot to say prior to that, the last appointment before that, she said, “You know, I don’t see anything.  I don’t see any inflammation anymore.  I think your problem is resolved, but we are going to check in four months.”  So on that four-month, that’s when they wanted to do the MRI.  And I thought they’d made a mistake.  I just said, “Would you double-check, please, because she never mentioned that to me” and, you know, I thought I was mixed up with another patient or something.  And they said, “No, no.”  They verified and called me back and, “She does want you to come in and have an MRI.”  Well thank God.  I went in and I didn't even know that that’s what should have been done.  \",\n",
       " \"Because during that year’s time, my oncologist in Stockton -- I was telling him what I was going through at my visits with him -- he wasn't ordering an MRI, he wasn't concerned.  You know, and I even had brought my report from the ultrasounds and he wasn't going to read it.  I mean, he just didn't think it was anything.  So when that year was up and they did the MRI, it came back multiple tumors, multiple tumors.  And so then they did a PET scan, highly suspicious for metastatic reoccurrence.  And so that’s when – her name was Dr. Eve or is Dr. Eve – and that’s when she said, “I am so sorry.  I’m so sorry.”  She said, “I can schedule you for surgery this week and we can deal with this.”  I said, “Thank you, no, I’m going to UCSF.”  And I just said, “No, I’m done, I am so done.”  And so by the grace of God, I didn't have her --  If she would've cut into me then, with what I found out later, I don’t think I’d be here today.  I’m sure I wouldn't be.  And so I’m telling you, I have a very strong faith and by God’s grace --\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, you mentioned that.',\n",
       " \"Oh, my gosh.  That’s the only way I’ve gotten through any of this, 'cause I am not a strong person.  But God’s helped me and made me strong and he has worked miracles, many miracles, and this is one of them.  Because if they had opened me up and cut, it would've just been everywhere.  So what happened then was when I went to UCSF, oh, everything was done so well, with such excellence.  And my very first visit, I remember bringing all my big bag – I had an Olive Garden bag.\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, a tote.  I mean, just huge.  And it was filled with all my films and all my everything, all the reports, everything.  And it was Dr. Cheryl Ewing that I saw at that time.  And I remember seeing her down the hall and she had my bag and she said, “I’ll be a while, you know, and I’ll be right back.”  And she came in.  I spoke with the resident and it was such a good experience.  She came in and by heart she knew my entire history.  I mean, she just said it back to me, everything.  And at that time, I was typing up everything that I had gone through, every date, every everything.  Now I stopped doing that but I just had everything.  You know, I may start up again but at some point I just felt like enough was enough and I had to quit.  But I had everything, every date, every diagnosis, every test, every MRI, every PET scan, every everything.',\n",
       " 'Oh, my sister was an R.N. and so she was a retired R.N. and she told me to do it.  She said, you know, “Keep your own history.”  She’s the one who also said, “Get your own lab reports, get copies of everything and just keep your own file.”',\n",
       " 'Oh, interesting.',\n",
       " \"Yeah.  And I did it for a while and then I stopped at one point.  I think 'cause emotionally I just felt I just have to rest for a while, you know, but I was diligent for a long time.  And so then the procedure then was to have chemo first for five months and then have surgery, and so that’s what we did.  And so that was ’06 so that was summer of 2006.  I had the surgery.  It ended up to be Dr. Laura Esserman(?).  I think Dr. Ewing was out on leave at that time and so Dr. Esserman did my surgery.  She removed 29 lymph nodes and I was told later that four were the size of golf balls.  And also on that first visit, at my first visit at UCSF, I found out that day – they sent me down the hall and a wonderful person, doctor, technician – I’m not sure what her title is – but she just felt the side of my body and needle aspirated right there.  And in Modesto they wouldn't do it because the radiologist thought that – he said it was a spring-loaded mechanism that would possibly rupture the implant.  But here they just felt by hand, aspirated a second time, she got it, put it under the microscope, had our answer right then and there.  It was wonderful.  So anyway, so then that surgery – the chemo, the surgery --  After that, I mean, everything was going well.  I can’t remember how long when it came back.  Hmm.  Meanwhile, I had cancer of the thyroid and I had my thyroid removed in between there.\",\n",
       " 'I’m sorry.  Was that a metastasis or is that something different?',\n",
       " \"No, something different, a different type of cancer.  Yeah.  Just thyroid is different than – it wasn't breast metastasis.  But then the next time what happened was I started to have pain in my neck and shoulder area.  Gosh, was that ’09?  It might have been ’09.  I want to say, I think it was 2009.  And so at first when we were --  And I had had regular visits with Dr. Melaser(?).  Wonderful, absolutely wonderful care, the best, and always on top of things.  So anyway, I’m trying to think.  Well so when I had the pain, we thought it was --  I work on the computer all day and so we thought maybe it was just disc and neck, 'cause I’ve had some issues with pain and a little arthritis in the neck area.  So I went to a lot of different doctors.  I went to a spinal doctor in Stockton, I went to even a neurologist.  I was having some symptoms and we just weren't sure what was causing it -- and then a spinal doctor here, Dr. Ames.  So what came of it was they had me do a lot of MRIs and they kept seeing shadowing on the MRIs and they weren't sure what they were seeing.  \",\n",
       " \"So what we finally did is have a needle biopsy and that did reveal cancer, that it had spread to the spinal area.  So then I started taking Herceptin and Zonada(?).  Dr. Melaser arranged that.  I did have radiation on the spinal area and neck and mid-back.  So then the Herceptin and Zonada.  Oh, because then it came in the bone marrow of the hip.  The Herceptin has healed that in the bone marrow of the hip.  That’s gone.  The cancer that’s in the spine is still there.  Dr. Melaser did say, “I don’t have a lot.”  It’s just where it was, affected the nerves and things.  So anyway, I had a year of pain but through that – I mean, now the Herceptin, like I say, did heal that.  It’s gone in the bone marrow of the hip.  Oh, and my hand would like freeze, it would like contort and freeze and then I would have zingers of pain, and for the year it was pretty much constant pain and I was on different pain medications for that, working the whole time, you know, like God’s grace again.  Oh, the Ticurb(?) that I’m on now, I take 750 milligrams of Ticurb every night.  Since I’ve taken that since March, I don’t have the pain any longer and I don’t even get the zingers.  After the radiation I didn't have the constant pain and I just had zingers and then with the Ticurb, I don’t have that, my hand doesn't contort or freeze up anymore, but then it was found that it did go to the brain.  And so then I had whole brain radiation, ended last December and have been going ever since.  So that’s the history in a nutshell.\",\n",

I am just so grateful to be here because I feel like the mistakes that happened to me shouldn't have happened and I just feel like the level of care here is just the top, you know, is just the best and I have that knowledge.  I mean, I just believe that.  It’s just everyone that has taken care of me has done so well by me and just so thorough and it’s been fantastic.\",\n",
       " 'No.  [Chuckles]  I would say no.  Oh, and I had genetic counseling here.  It was wonderful.',\n",

       " 'What kind do I want to get from him?',\n",
       " 'Uh-huh.',\n",
       " 'Well I feel very confident in him.  He has me get PET scans every six months and if I say I have pain somewhere or struggling in a certain way with something, he gets the testing done, the MRIs, the testing.  So I feel like he’s on top of it, so I don’t really ask a lot of questions except I tell him any symptom I’m having, I mean, just any detail, even if it seems silly to me.  The littlest things I tell him, you know, I just tell him everything.  And so he – and then either it’s something we don’t need to worry about or if it is something, he’s right on it about getting testing done.',\n",

I would look things up on the Internet, I really --  But at one point it got more upsetting for me, you know, and so then I just thought no, I’m just trusting my doctor.  Now I’m not saying I won’t again but that was --  I would try to go to sites like Web M.D. and oh, what’s the one?  I want to say it starts with an M.  Mayo Clinic.  Okay, there we go.',\n",

       " 'Okay.  Where were you at that point?  [..?..]?',\n",
       " \"Okay, let’s see.  That would've been, I think it was when it went maybe to the bone marrow.  Because it was the spine first and then I think it’s when it went to the bone marrow, if I’m right, that I had looked up and I found out that I was Stage IV and I didn't know I was Stage IV, you know, and so that shook me a lot.\",\n",
       " 'Looking at the Internet.',\n",
       " 'Oh.',\n",
       " \"Yes, and I did not know that and it really did shake me.  But it explained that Stage IV only means it metastasized to another site other than the original site.  And so I did ask Dr. Melaser.  And that’s another thing.  I mean, whatever questions I have I write out usually, I mean, I usually have a notebook.  Now I haven't the last couple of times brought it in but I have a notebook.  I write my questions, I leave a little space, and then write the next question and he is so good to answer every question I have.  Well that time I asked him, I just said, “Am I incurable?”  Well I said, “Am I Stage IV?”  And he said, “Yes.” And I said, “Am I incurable?”  And he said, “Well I can say that today you might be considered incurable, but tomorrow you may not be.”  And he said, “Like a diabetic, you know, there’s no cure for diabetes and yet people can live the course of their entire lifetime.”  And so he was very comforting in that.  But I did stop with the Internet at that point because it just shook me.  And then I had some time before I saw him and so I just thought oh, no.  I was really a mess, you know.\",\n",

Through two times of chemo, full-time, through the PIK line, through the IV antibiotics, through the brain radiation.  I took ten days off for brain radiation and then there was the steroid therapy after that.  And I mean, it hasn't always been easy but there again, it’s the grace of God, it’s the strength of God.  And people will say to me, you know, “I can’t believe you’re still working.  I can’t believe you’re so strong.”  I’m not strong; God’s strong in me and that’s something that I know for a fact.  I am a scared person, you know.  The peace and strength of God is what has gotten me through and his work, his miracles, and I consider --  And I tell my doctors.  I tell Dr. Melaser and I tell Dr. Baroni, you know, “I’m praying for miracles and you’re part of this miracle.”  Their treatment and their expertise is very much a miracle.\",\n",

My husband, he’s a wonderful man, a wonderful support, but he just, his kind of way is just like, “You’re going to be fine, you’re going to be fine,” you know, and so it’s like I can’t --  I mean, I can share fully, you know, exactly how I’m feeling and what I’m going through but you know, he’s just kind of, you know, “You’re fine.”  But I have much support.  We have dear friends at church and just dear life friends that pray with me, and then that has a ripple effect.  I mean, they ask others to pray and I’ve got just so many people, and then people at work, you know, too, that pray and that are wonderful friends as well.  And just good support that way.  ',\n",

And so when that year was up, I started having symptoms.  I started kind of having all sorts of things happen.  I remember my ears plugging and unplugging and I had headaches.  I just went through something and I just had anxiety.  Because then, when we started doing some MRIs and a lot of looking for things and I got scared and that’s why I started seeing the counselor.  Well she is also a nurse as well as a counselor and I am so grateful.  My sister passed away two years ago and so my counselor is someone that I can bounce things off of with medical questions too.

Number one to me is prayer.  I talk with my family, I do talk with my counselor and, you know, those are things – and I trust my doctors, I trust them.  And I mean, they’ve shown me that they’re dedicated to me and that they’re going to do everything that they can.  It’s not like what happened before when things were done not well, you know.

Sometimes I’m afraid, you know, like what if I can’t work full time and what’s going to happen to us then?  I don’t think I’d be able to come here, you know.

So I had that four and a half months of EOX over here and it did nothing.  And I was pretty sick with it, actually, and so I was going to get a break and during that break we decided we’d look for clinical trials.  And Dr. Coe happened to have a clinical trial that he was opening that would give me the same chemo as they would've given me over here, which he agreed would be the second line to try.  And if his clinical trial was going to open in the amount of time that I thought I could wait or was willing to wait, that the clinical trial would be fine.  The mystery drug, whether I’m getting it or not, if I’m getting it, it’s great.  It’s an anti-angio(?) genesis drug that basically knocks down the blood flow to the cancer and kills it.  It would be great.  But if I didn't get it, at least I was getting the same chemotherapy.  And so I ended that [..?..]…[recording fades out]…\",\n",
       " \"Well he just makes you feel so secure.  I don't know.  There’s just an air about him.  He’s very --  I really liked my oncologist over here.  This is nothing against anybody at the Cancer Care.  They did a beautiful job as well.  But he just really, I don't know, he looks at you.  He really sees you – [crying] – sorry --\",\n",
       " \"-- he really sees you and he just makes you feel so comfortable and he’s so positive, even in the most negative times he’s really positive.  So I liked that and my husband liked it too and everybody -- I talked to my family about him – could tell that I had kind of a special thing for him.  So anyway, I ended up with him.  I was really going for him.  I didn't really --  I mean, he told us about – he didn't tell us really about any other clinical trials from anyone else, but I’m not sure I would've done it with anyone else.  He just really gave me tons of confidence and consequently, you know, I feel like I’m on the right road.  And when I see him, I just feel great.  Even if I just touch his hand, just kind of one of those things.  Anyway, that’s how I ended up there.\",\n",

       " \"I hadn't been feeling good for a while.  I’d been really tired and my appetite at dinnertime --  This started probably last – well when I noticed it, it probably started January of 2010.  But I just, you know, come dinnertime, I wasn't interested in eating dinner and I climbed --  When I worked at UCSF I parked in a parking lot and you had to go up 142 steps.  And the first time I did that I knew I’d be exhausted but you would think you would improve, working three days a week, climbing 142 steps three days a week.  You would think that you would improve, and I didn't really improve.  It wasn't so much that my heart was racing or something.  It was my legs ached and I’d just have to stop and kind of stretch and then continue on.  So it was more of a muscular thing.  And then I just kind of didn't --  I obviously ignored it, you know, 'cause I could work.  At work I was fine.  I hustled all the time.  It was just going up those steps, I really noticed at the end of the day.  Anyway, as time went on just the not eating at night seemed weird to my husband.  Like I’d lose my appetite for certain things.  I wouldn't want salads for a while.  He just thought it was strange and I did too.  But we were doing things.  I mean, I did all my normal activities.  I never said, “No, I’m too tired to do that.”  It was not a matter of being really – I was fatigued, I know, as compared to normal, but I also wasn't exercising at the time.  You know, you could come up with a lot of reasons why you felt crappy, and I wasn't exercising at the time.  I just didn't feel right.  Anyway, I put it off for a long time.  And we went in August --  You can tell: January to August.  We went to Tahoe, which we do every summer for a week, and I did all my normal activities up there but I didn't feel great again.  I knew something was off.  And like I worked with my husband to prepare most of the meals and it was almost like ooh, I didn't even want to look at that food at this point.  And normally I have wine or whatever and it just really wasn't tasting very good to me.  So anyway, and at the very end of that vacation I got some – well I don’t even know today whether they were bites or what they were, but there was a cluster of five sores.  And got them and I thought ugh, and John thought I had just gotten bit by a spider in the bed or something.  But they started looking more like chicken pox or something.  And I went to work that last week of August, I went to work, which ended up being -- like I think the 27th of August was the last day I worked.  And I had been to the doctor.  My NP -- on the Friday prior to that, which – I don’t even know what that would be – like the 21st or the 20th of August – showed her my sores 'cause they weren't reconciling and they were itching like crazy.  And she goes, “Oh, gosh, I think you might have shingles.”  Well I had had shingles once before and shingles usually, you know, follows the nerve pattern and this was just really like a cluster but they looked like chicken pox.  So I went on – I don’t know what.  I can’t even remember the name of the drug, but it’s the anti-fungal or whatever it is they give you.  And she goes, “I think we’re a little late onset of doing this but why don’t we go ahead and try it.”  And I said okay.  And every day I was on it, I started it and I got sicker every day.  And so she had called me at work the Friday of the 27th and said, “Sheila, your blood test last weekend that you got shows your liver enzymes are way up.”  She goes, “But we think it’s a mistake.  You’ve never had a problem.”  And I should've told her that I was not feeling well, but she said, “Why don’t you stop taking the antibiotic that we’re giving you.”  And I said, “Well that’s good because I’m just getting sick on it and I actually stopped it yesterday because I’m just not feeling good on it.  I’m feeling worse on it.”  That’s all I said to her.  And I really should've told her, “I believe those liver enzymes.  There’s something going on.”  Although I didn't really have, you know, looking back, I probably was even getting yellow and not realizing it, 'cause it was just happening mildly.  And you get a tan or you self-tan or whatever.  Anyway, so I went and got my blood – I felt terrible by that weekend and I went and got my blood drawn and that would've been the 28th.  And I even called my sister-in-law, who’s a pediatrician, and we were talking about my symptoms, and I was itching and I was making dark-colored urine.  And I said, “God, I feel like I’ve got hepatitis or something.”  And she goes, “Well it sounds like hepatitis.  Have you gotten a needle stick recently?”  And I said, “Gosh, I can’t remember getting a needle stick but God, I don't know how else I’d get hepatitis.  I mean, I must have a hepatitis I’m not vaccinated for.”  So then I was worried about Hepatitis C and I thought oh, my God…  But anyway, I said well I’m going to make an appointment with my regular doctor, my primary, not the NP but my primary on Monday and tell him that we just have to figure this out.  Well by Monday I was even sicker.  I was itching and you could tell I was yellow.  And my eyes weren't really yellow.  Like you had to really lower my lid and they mostly could tell underneath my tongue, which I didn't realize was a diagnostic, but under your tongue – is yellow.  And he said, “You know, Sheila, from your symptoms it sounds like something’s blocked up there.”  ‘Cause the second set of labs my AST and my ALT had come down a bit but my --  But the AST, which shows blockage, had really zoomed up to, I don't know, 1300 or something.  Anyway, it was very high.  And he said, “I think you might have an imbedded gallstone or something that’s blocking you.”  And he said, “So I’m going to send you to Marin General” 'cause it was late in the afternoon, “I’m going to send you to Marin General, I’m going to have them do an ultrasound and if it’s an imbedded gallstone they will just remove it.  They’ll take you to surgery tonight, they’ll remove it; you’ll start feeling better tomorrow.”  And I thought that’s great.  I wasn't worried about the surgery or anything.  I just wanted to feel better 'cause I was worse every day I woke up.  So I called my husband.  I said, “The plan is, going to go ultrasound me.  He thinks I’ve got a gallstone or something that’s, for some reason, not passing 'cause I don’t have any pain.  And because I don’t have any pain, I think he thinks that it’s partially imbedded and not completely, but it’s blocking, obviously, my duct and they might take it out tonight.”  And so my husband met me at the ER and – but they kept saying, “You don’t have any pain?”  And I was like, “No.”  He goes, “Well I think we’re going to do a CAT scan.”  And I said, “I don't care, whatever needs to be done.”  And so he did a CAT scan and I felt so bad really – I can’t remember the guy’s name.  I took him a snack --  After I was feeling better I took him a little thank you, because it must have been really hard for him to come in and tell us what he had to tell us.  And he couldn't even really give us specifics 'cause he didn't know what type of cancer I had.  He just knew from the CAT scan that my cancer had spread to my omentum.  And he showed us on there and I said, “Oh, so tri-level omentum.  What does that mean?”  And he goes, “Normally it means cancer.”  And of course we were devastated.  And I thought God, if we feel this way, he must have just felt horrible.  I felt worse for him at the time, actually, 'cause it obviously wasn't sinking into my brain yet, right?\",\n",
       " \"What?  Remind me what the question is, 'cause I get in these stories and I --\",\n",
       " 'Yeah.  So that’s how we found out.',\n",
       " 'That was the initial.  And then it was the investigation of what my primary site was, which took almost a month.',\n",
       " \"It was scary because --  Well a couple things happened.  Marin General was fabulous.  They took me in and they biopsied --  Well the first thing they said was that my common bile duct was blocked and it was probably blocked by a node or something.  So they, the very next day, took me in and put a stent in my bile duct.  And they were worried at the time that they might find tumors up there, and I was worried too because my daughter’s best friend’s mother had just died from six weeks of bile duct cancer and I thought ugh.  And my husband thought I was dying too.  So anyway that was the good news.  They didn't find any cancer up there and they opened up my bile duct and it took quite a while but that resolved all my itching.  But with the itching came Grove’s disease.  Not many people can tell you much about it and there’s not much on the Internet, but it was a rash that was absolutely miserable.  And I think it mixed with the bile salts in my skin and it was horrible.  So all I could think about while they were doing all the rest of this investigation was this terrible rash I had all over my body.  So day one they did my bile duct.  Day two they biopsied my omentum and we had to wait a little while but we got the results back with the type of cancer it was.  And it gives you three other places to look for primary existence.  The first one was my pancreas, which did not make me happy, not that anything would but that really didn't make it.  No, the first one they thought was ovarian.  I think they automatically just thought it was ovarian 'cause I have so much cancer in my family history.  My mom died of metastatic breast cancer.  But they drew the blood for ovarian cancer and they waited for the results of that, which took about a week, and it was inconclusive and not really showing, like sparking.  So he said, “I think we have to throw pancreatic back in there, and I’m going to get you a PET CT.”  So I did that and through the PET CT they found it was not pancreatic but a small, very small section of my stomach, which was the third option -- there was ovarian, pancreatic and stomach -- a very small section of not a tumor but cellular level cancer, which then had spread to my omentum and probably in turn had spread to my ovaries but in such a small amount it didn't really show any uptake.  So we were so thrilled that I didn't have pancreatic cancer, that stomach cancer, not knowing anything about it, it seemed like okay, fine, we’ll do that one.  And so then I asked him to stage it for me and he said well it’s stage IV, which didn't make me very happy, and that was Dr. Metzger staged it for me.  And he said anything that goes outside is called stage IV.  So stage IV is not a good thing to have, granted, but it doesn't necessarily really tell you that much more, other than that it’s spread.  That’s it, period.  So that’s how I found out.\",\n",
       " \"Very slow-moving and I probably had – Dr. Metzger told me I could've had this for a few months or I could've had it for a year.  It’s very slow.  Could I have made a difference if I went in January, he’s not even sure 'cause it didn't hardly show up on the PET scan, it was so small.  And it’s not --  You know, I was having GI symptoms for pain and all that kind of stuff, but something that – they probably would've ruled out a lot of other things before they went to the cancer.  So he did assure me that it’s kind of the silent type thing, but very slow-moving, which is why he didn't mind waiting like two months or he didn't mind me being off chemo for two months.  You know, he would be really good about explaining that cancer is different than like if you have an infection.  It just moves differently and it works through your body differently and so you don’t think of it as an infection that just can take over your body in a day.  I mean, some cancers can do that, but this particular type if slow-moving.\",\n",
       " \"Between, as I finished my --  Well I was too sick to have any more chemo and the PET scan that I had, my last just regular PET scan, showed that there was no difference.  I had a PET scan at three months, which showed nothing, and he kind of said to us at three months that if you don’t get any difference on your three-month one, there’s probably not going to be a difference on your sixth month one, but we convinced him to keep going because what was my other option?  I didn't have any other option.  And I had missed a couple of chemo doses 'cause my counts weren’t good enough and I just felt like I didn't get enough, even though I didn't really like it.  And he concurred with Dr. Coe and Dr. Coe said yeah, he would continue another three months and get a PET scan.  So the PET scan at three months was there was no difference.  So he said, “You obviously need a break, and we’ll give you a break.”  And that’s when we started talking about clinical trials and all that kind of stuff.\",\n",
       " \"Well working at the University, you know, clinical trials are going on all the time.  But we did bring it up with him because I just kind of wanted to know the schematic of where a clinical trial fit in.  I had always been under the impression that people went to clinical trials because it was like the last ditch effort and that’s not really true, especially a matching one for me, which I’m really getting an extra bonus check.  If I’m getting the experimental drug, it’s just a bonus check to me.  Otherwise, I’m just at the level that I would be here and dealing with what I would be here.  There may be, I’m sure there are people that go to clinical trials as a last ditch effort but it doesn't have to be seen that way.  Like for example, if I for some reason can’t make this clinical trial --  Like this clinical trial that I’m doing currently is such that either you do better and they keep you on it until they get the results they want, or you don’t show any improvement or you show a worsening and then they move you out of the trial, not because they don’t want you to be in the trial but because you need to be someplace where you can get what you need.  And there are other drugs they can try on me, so they tell me, not that many but there are a couple others.  But I knew clinical trials, working in the ICU, many of our attendings do research – all of them do the research basically, and they’re always talking about clinical trials.  Theirs are more done with animals, the ones that I know of, but I knew of a lot of ones that are done with people too, all over the country.  And I know some people who have entered them and things like that, so I had some knowledge of it so that’s why we brought it up really early in the discussion, just to kind of see where it would fit in.  I never dreamed, to be honest with you, that I would be in a clinical trial right now.  I thought it was going to be six months of chemotherapy and I’d move on.  That’s really what my thought process was.  Give me the nastiest stuff you can give me that you think will work.  And it just didn't mix with my body chemistry 'cause I think everybody’s body chemistry does something different.  ‘Cause to me, I’m saying if they think Taxol’s a good one, why didn't they give that to me first.  But they were very adamant, Dr. Coe too, that the EOX was the way, you know, and that’s three chemos.  One taking chemo every day.  So I thought well I’m stage IV.  They must think I really need all my bases covered, but it just didn't work with my body chemistry.\",\n",
       " 'Well I have friends who know people that have been in trials.  I was probably unclear.  I don’t have a family member or anything that’s ever participated in a clinical trial.',\n",
       " 'My stage?',\n",
       " 'Oh, it’s a Phase II trial.',\n",
       " \"To me?  The way I understand it is Phase II, they’ve already gone through and kind of determined the dosage and what the likely outcomes are.  And I’m not in that part of it.  They’ve already done that.  So they know what they want to give me and they know what they’re hoping for.  But I am still in a double-blind study so nobody knows if I’m getting the drug, which is a bummer.  If I was in a Phase III, I would know I’m getting it, I think, or I wouldn't be getting it.  But who would go through this if they thought they weren't getting it?  If they told me I was getting a placebo, I probably wouldn't want to travel to UC three days a week if I could get the same thing close to home.  And especially just because my two doctors communicate so much.  If I felt my doctor was isolated over here, I might feel differently 'cause it is to much about the doctor and the knowledge.  And that’s what always made me feel --  And I was pretty frank with Dr. Metzger over here that, you know, I wanted him to communicate with Dr. Coe and if that wasn't going to be happening --  I mean, I think I almost offended him one time, asking him a question.  He goes, “This is what I do for a living.”  ‘Cause I said, “Did you check with Dr. Coe?” as if Dr. Coe was his father or something, you know.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah.  Well just because I think the University, I mean, they have a lot of stuff available to them and a lot of information available to them.  And although I’ve only ever worked on the patient care side, which I see a very different side of people in the clinical arena, our docs were constantly calling physicians from other parts if they were stumped or if they wanted a second --  There was not a problem with them calling colleagues.  And so I just, having gone to Dr. Coe for a second opinion and feeling that he’s known kind of as the guru over there, he’s the guy to be with for what I have, that if there was a way to do my care over here with him involved but do it over here, that to me was really important.  And if that couldn't have happened, it may have changed my options.  Like if I had known that I went for a second opinion and that that was going to be all I did, the second opinion really doesn't tell you that much.  To be honest, [..?..] opinions were very quick.  Yeah, I agree with what he’s doing, or it could be no, I don’t agree and then you’re in a dilemma.  So if you’re in a dilemma that says no, I don’t agree, this is what I do, then it really is going to fall to the physician that you feel the most comfortable with.  And I just feel that the University offers that one extra step of knowledge.  And since I worked there so long and it is right here, why wouldn't I use it?  And a lot of people, when I was going here for my first round, were saying, “Why are you at UC?”  But, you know, I didn't think the first round --  When you’re not in a clinical trial, I’m sure they don’t do things much different than they do over here.  The clinical trial makes it different 'cause they monitor you so closely and you have a lot of people looking at you all the time.  So I think that that’s why I decided to stay here, 'cause I felt like I – and I do still feel like I got what I needed here.\",\n",
       " 'Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, going weekly, is that a hardship?  I think it’s a hardship.  My husband goes with me every week, except when my daughters are home when I get chemo.  Then they go.  And a zillion, million friends have offered, but my infusion times are pretty long.  I’m there a long time.',\n",
       " \"Well when I get double-dosed, you know, I go get labs so I’m there at 8:30 in the morning and I get out of there about 5:30.  And I don’t feel comfortable asking a friend to go sit there that long, especially 'cause I sleep through the chemo most the time.  So I like to keep it to just family.  Now my best friend in the whole world lives in Boston but they bought a house out here.  She’s gone with me a couple times.  She just knows what it is and she, you know, she’s happy to do it.  But I’m very picky about who goes with me, and people are like, “Well I can take you in the morning and then so and so can meet in the afternoon”, and if I ever get to that point, I will.  You know, a year or if this goes on longer than a year, that’s going to be a hardship for my husband.  But I think he wants, it’s one of the things he wants to be there, to see the doctor anyway, and we go to the doctor every time before.  Did that answer that?\",\n",
       " 'I get lost in the question, believe me.',\n",
       " 'At UCSF?',\n",
       " 'Well I think, you know, the very first time I went to the Infusion Center, I don’t think anybody knew who I was even though I’d worked there for 30 years.  I mean, you just don’t see those people.  You don’t see anyone other than people that are in your style of practice or in your unit most of the time.',\n",
       " \"Well as I found out, a lot of these nurses in the Infusion Center were at UC and I recognized a lot of their faces, probably from the elevator or the cafeteria.  But they had been in the Infusion Center for ten years so I probably didn't see them much.  But anyway, they didn't know who I was.  You know, I just was another person having cancer treatment.  And the first day I was there, they have different rooms and one room has a lot of chairs in that room and it’s very noisy and I was put in there.  And I have no complaints about the care.  I can’t.  It’s just it was my very first time, I think, and it was noisy and everybody’s pumps were going off and they were busy.  My nurse was great.  I said, “Will I have you next week?”  And she was like, “Well probably not because we work three days a week.”  And it was hard for me because I just thought God, I don’t want to tell everybody the same story.  I really would like someone the same.  And our unit that I worked in, when we got patients you could just see that was one of the parents’ complaints.  Parents who had inconsistency of nursing were just like, “God, I’m tired of telling my story for the tenth, fifteenth time,” and you would always be like I can understand that, but at the same time you realized maybe giving them the same nurse wasn't possible.  So I just called my head nurse and I said, you know --  I’ve never asked for any favors and I know we do it in our unit, that if we have a VIP come in or we have a friend of a friend, they’ll say, you know, “Can you give them the lighted room, or can you make sure that X, Y or Z happens” and we do the best we can, always knowing that, you know, depends on how things go, but trying to be accommodating.  And I thought heck, I’m just going to ask for the same, this one time.  So I called her and I said, “Can you call the head nurse over there and just find out how things work.”  ‘Cause over here in Marin they toured me before I ever came, they gave me education on my chemotherapy I was going to get before I ever came.  I already knew a couple of the nurses before I came.  I had the same nurse every week and I had the same like infusion chair every week.  I didn't need to be that specific but they were very accommodating.  And so I just said, “Could you call the head nurse over there and find out how things work?  Is there any way I can get even a group, just even one or two of the same nurses?  I know probably one person works every Wednesday.  And really, if I could have a corner pocket where it’s quieter.  You know, I’m going to be coming there a long time.  My infusions are long and I’m sure there’s other patients that are in the same position.  I don’t want to put anybody out but I just really feel like this one time I can ask that.”  So she said she would and she did and I’m telling you, it’s the second time I’ve come --  It’s not like they say, “Hi, Sheila.”  My nurse is that familiar with me but the rest of the nurses aren’t that familiar with me.  But they at least know that I worked there for 30 years and, you know, that I was working right up ‘til the point – and they give me a quiet spot and I have only had one different nurse since that time.  She’s great.  They’re all great over there.  I’d be happy to have any of them.  But the fact that I get one as often as I do, she knows me from week to week, she follows my counts and she can give me insights.  If she’s busy, I don’t mind waiting 'cause I know how that gets so I don’t get nasty about having to wait for a while because they’re busy, they’re hugely busy over there.  But it’s just nice for that reason too, that you kind of know what this person’s pattern is and she’s very experienced, as many of them are.  But I found out that there’s a group of them that went over about ten years ago, so they have a big group of really experienced nurses that have been there for ten years, so you feel like you’re really, the quality is just really good.  And I’ve seen a lot, obviously, 'cause there’s never an empty chair there.  So anyway…\",\n",
       " 'Well I’ll tell you, I don’t look on the Internet.',\n",
       " \"No, no, no, I did at first and we were told sites to go to.  But it was overwhelming to me.  And I think my daughters did the Internet searching for me, to be honest with you.  They were on it right away, they could, you know, tell me what I thought was like crazy.  So they’re the Internet queens, my daughters are, and they Internet for me.  The husband went on it the first night and after that I said, “You know, we’re not internetting this anymore.”  We go on and we’ll look up drugs, specific things, but I don’t peruse, I don’t blog, I don’t do any of that.  It just makes me too uncomfortable.  I wasn't a techy person.  I think if I’d been a techy person before, someone who used their computer for business all the time and searched the Internet all the time – 'cause I know there’s tons of stuff.  But even when we went on about clinical trials when we first thought – you know, at the very beginning when we even thought about clinical trials, there’s so many clinical trials going on and it’s so much information and it’s not clear who does what or who, you know…  And I had no intention of moving somewhere.  Like my friend that lives in Boston, “Well you can come live with me.”  Well I have a son in high school and, you know, I want to be around my family.  I mean, not that Sarah’s not my family.  She’s like a sister.  But I had no intention of moving, so that kind of really cancels a lot of clinical trials for you.  And initially I was just thinking clinical trial would be way down the road.  I might change my mind if I could barely lift my head off the pillow but --  So we kind of used it for that and it was just so confusing.  I think John’s on it and I don't know.  You know, he doesn't always tell me.  But we found just so much negative stuff on there and kind of scary stuff that you don’t – you know, “don’t ask, don’t tell me”.  I’m not there yet.  That was our initial experience.  And I just said we’re not looking at the Internet anymore.  We’re going to ask the questions that we need to ask and we’re going to be comfortable with who we’re seeing and we’re going to make sure they’re really available and that we can call them at any time, which they were over there and they are over here.  “Just email me or call me.  Leave a voicemail any time.  Don’t have an unanswered question.”  So I felt like if I had real questions I could --  I didn't need to know how many people survived or what my percentage was at five years.  I don’t need to know that.\",\n",
       " \"Uh-huh.  I mean, a lot of it was negative but also, you know, I couldn't be really specific about what I was looking for.  I mean, I think when I was first on the Internet I was looking for, to go to a site and they say, “These people, this percentage has been successfully treated with A, B, C,” and they can’t really tell you that.  If you go to gastro – whatever it is – you go to that, it’s not --  I know a lot of people that have survived colon cancer.  I hear about it all the time.  But what I learned was stomach cancer’s not that familiar or they’re not that, not that  common in women and it’s just the stuff that I didn't really --  I think I was at the time perusing for --  I mean, I may come to a time where I’m more interested in using the Internet, but I hadn't been a big Internet person before so probably my reaction to it wasn't that uncommon.  Whereas my girls, they look everything up and they’re very informed.  Even if we don’t talk about it, they know the statistics and, yeah, they know all that.  But they also look deeper, which I never would.  They look at blogs.  They’ll come home and say, “Look, a lot of people mentioned this on the blog” or, you know, they talk to John about it more.  But for me, I would say I’m not an Internet person.\",\n",

I don’t access information specifically on stage IV stomach cancer 'cause I don't know how much research --  And now I feel like I’m with the main man, so I really put a lot of faith in him that he --  You know, I mentioned things.  They say, “Yeah, that’s typical.”  And so in some ways, it would be nice to have that little portfolio in front of you, say, you know, “For stomach cancer, these are things you expect.”  But everybody’s body is different.  They react to the chemo different, and everything I bring up is --  I mean, I have a lot of time on my hands so I analyze everything, which makes you feel like I should be somebody who should be on the Internet all the time, but --\",\n",
       " \"I analyze it in my mind based on my clinical experience, you know, 30 years.  So things that I think are really life-threatening or something like that I would email about it, but most things, since I see them every week, I can talk to them about it every week and I haven't come up with anything hugely abnormal yet.\",\n",

       " \"This will be a short answer.  I get chemo three Wednesdays, consecutive Wednesdays, and then I get one Wednesday off.  That’s the general plan.  I get my chemotherapy every week and I get my mystery drug two of those sessions.  So I get two infusions on the first Wednesday, one infusion of just my chemo on a second, which is what I had yesterday, and then I get two the third Wednesday.  And then I get a week off.  And that’s the routine for the chemotherapy.  They tell you to expect to get fatigued, which I am, and, you know, and I’m sure from my last experience it gets a cumulative effect, that --  I actually felt pretty good the first round and it’s harder every round.  And they --  But they want you to eat and I actually have a great appetite.  My first round of chemo I couldn't eat anything.  I couldn't drink anything but hot water.  And this one I can eat and drink just about anything.  I just can’t eat very much of it, so I know I’m not eating enough calories.  I have to supplement that with something.  But the nutrition part, I know they probably have a nutritionist and I actually have a nutritionist here in Marin that I could go see too, but I have not done that yet.  I did it initially but I haven't done it [..?..].  But in terms of routines for them, it’s really just the three weeks and the week off and try to get as much exercise as you can, which is hard when you’re fatigued.  And I’m not exercising as much as I should but I do move around as much as --  On good days I try to make the most of it.  Bad days, I try to just forgive myself for being a slug.  So that’s it.  They don’t really require much of you.\",\n",

But anyway, I think every week wears on you, especially this time.  I didn't really have any reprieve.  I didn't have – none of the six days between, I didn't feel good, any of them, really.  So I think that’s hard when you have a week like that.  That’s probably affecting me somewhat.  But I’m not fearful of the chemo.  Like I get really kind of nervous and kind of emotional the morning of.  Like in the car I’ll be like “ooh.”  My husband will say, “What’s wrong, Sheila?”  And I say, “I can’t tell you.  It’s just, it’s getting started.  Once I’m at Mt. Zion, once we’ve parked and I’m heading – that all goes away.  It’s just getting involved in the process and being part of the process.  So I feel fine with that.  But I think it wears on you.  It wears on you because you’re kind of the center of the family and you know it wears on them.  They’re great, they’re all great but, you know, God, [crying] it’s been almost nine months and this clinical trial is, you know, is --  It’s unfortunate I’ve done the clinical trial that often or that long, but it’s at the end of the --  You know, it’s just been a long time.  I thought I was going to sweep this under the bridge at six months and be done with it.  So I think it’s wearing but, you know, at the same time, it’s my – even though I’m fatigued, I feel better.  I don't know if it’s 'cause they give me a smaller dose every week, rather than just pumping you with one big nastiness.  I don't know.  But overall, even though I don’t feel good, I don’t feel near as bad as I did the first time.  And I’m not crying 'cause it’s wearing on me.  This is just – I don't know.\",\n",
       " \"But anyway, I just --  So I would say that, that, you know, my husband has to take a lot of time off from work and every week, not just once a month that we have to plan for a Wednesday or Thursday.  You have to do it every week.  And my one daughter comes home the day after chemo every week.  She doesn't mind doing it and she works from home.  And then my one daughter makes trips from D.C. and stays two weeks a month sometimes to be with me, which she does not complain one stitch.  She’d rather be in California than D.C. anyway and they let her work from home, which is great.  But it’s expensive for her.  My family’s ready to do anything I want.  We were just talking about it this morning, 'cause usually we go to Tahoe in the summer and we’re not going to do that this year.  And she said, “Well we could go and just do a weekend.  We don’t have to do a whole week with tons of family that you have to cook and clean for.  We could just go for a weekend.”  And yeah, we could.  I just don’t know how I’m going to feel.  And even I say well I could lay on that bed as easy as my bed, but it’s really not the same.  When you don’t feel good you want to be at home base.  So I don't know, maybe in July or August I’ll feel better and feel more like it.  But I think the only thing about the clinical trial is just the weekly time.  I think the rest of it would come no matter where I was getting chemo.  It’s 'cause of the length of time that you’re on chemo is the length of time that it affects your family, 'cause not one person has cancer; everybody has it really. \",\n",
       " \"So it’s like anything.  It never involves one person.  And also time.  I realized I had to do other things that I’m doing.  I’m doing acupressure, which I didn't try the first time, and I’m seeing a social worker regularly.  I should've probably seen her this week.  I’m on an antidepressant, which I didn't do the first time, which I think I need to be a little adjusted, and I take stuff for anxiety.  So all the things that I really was like not wanting to do my first time, 'cause I didn't really want to take pills to begin with, I’m succumbing and saying okay.  You know what, I need these supportive mechanisms.  And the clinical trial doesn't tell you to do them but I asked right away, “Are a lot of your patients on anti” – I never asked over here but I asked there.  “Do they take anti-anxiety drugs?”  And they said absolutely.  And so I felt okay, I can take them.\",\n",
       " \"That was recommended to me but I happened to see Dr. Coe the day before I was going to get the prescription or the day before I was going to start it or I was going to see the social worker the next Monday and we were going to talk about it again.  And he said, “Absolutely.” And I said, “What about anxiety drugs?”  “Absolutely.”  And my social worker the week before has mentioned – or that Monday, and I saw him on Wednesday – and she’s the one that mentioned, “Are you not on these things?”  And I’m like, “No.”  And he confirmed.  He said, “Yeah, a lot of them are.”  He said, “There’s no crime.”  And I said, “No, I don’t feel that way about it.  It’s just I, you know, I don’t want to be” –  I kind of want to feel that I’m not being too stubborn.  I can be stubborn.  But anyway, once he said that I said, “Okay, fine.”  So I started and they helped, they totally helped.  That wasn't really part of that question but…\",\n",
       " \"He’s just very available.  He has a whole team and they’re just very available, down to the clinical coordinator.  I mean, you call them and you get some action on it.  The clinical coordinator is who I call first and he has never disappointed me.  I think it’s the fact that Dr. Coe is available himself all the time, but has just a group of people that are working with him that are monitoring you and seeing you.  I mean, that’s the good thing about going every week, even though I say it’s wearing.  The good thing is that you’re monitored so closely and he’s responsible for that and he sets up the teams, and he runs hundreds of clinical trials.  And he just knows --  I mean, there was a question --  I’ll give you an example.  There was a question when I couldn't keep my counts up and I had to keep not getting my chemotherapy.  I was like, “God, you know what, I might be getting the experimental drug but I might not be.  That’s a 50/50 chance.  I mean, I need the chemo.  So can’t we start Nupragen(?)?”  Well his fellow and the clinical coordinator weren't sure it was covered by the protocol.  And then the next week when I saw Dr. Coe, when my counts were actually okay to get chemo, he’s like, “You know, we’re going to have to help you through this.  I think we’re going to have to do Nupragen or something.”  I mean, he just knew right away that, you know, it should be in the protocol.  I’m sure it’s in the protocol and they found that it was accepted in the protocol.  So I think he has a knowledge of how protocols work.  And also, one time I went to him and my counts were a little low and he said, “We’re going to go ahead and give you the chemo anyway,” even though by a clinical trial, what was written on there didn't fit my motif.  I think he knows how to – I mean, he obviously has experience of when he can tweak and when he can’t.  ‘Cause he wants this clinical trial to be successful but he wants his patient --  I really feel Dr. Coe thinks of his patient first and the clinical trial second and that if he had any reason --  Like if I went next week and he said, “Sheila, you know what, I don’t think you should be on the clinical trial,” the biggest sadness for me would be not seeing him.  Because I know that he doesn't know if I’m on the placebo either, a placebo or the drug either, but he would be telling me that because he thinks I’m not getting what I need and he wants me to get what I need.  And I really do believe that about him.\",\n",
       " \"I can’t go out and exercise like crazy but I never did that anyway so that’s not --  I wasn't a big exercise person, to be honest with you.  I can do stuff for myself; it’s just hard, it’s really hard.  Like I can take care of myself.  When people aren’t here, I can take care of myself.  But coming out and cooking for yourself, it’s just really hard to know what you want and do you want to do it, and it’s just easier to lay in bed.  So it just takes a lot of effort to do everything that I do.  I’m much more knowledgeable.  Even a walk.  Because I have this neuropathy in my feet, I’m very much aware of walk.  I don’t lose myself in the good weather.  I can feel every step I take, you know, because of the swelling I get occasionally.  I think this is from the chemo yesterday.  It wasn't like that yesterday.  Anyway, so I feel everything.  I don’t have patience like I used to.  I can’t sit and read a book.  I was not really an avid reader for a long time and then people at work kind of started talking about reading.  I was like, “Gosh, you sit and read?”  I never felt comfortable like sitting and reading a book.  So I was reading and now people give me a long list of books and I have a stack of books that I haven't even looked at.  I just don’t have the patience.  My mind wanders and I just don’t have the patience for that.  I used to do the Sudoku all the time and I kind of stopped that.  I’ve now started that a bit.  I mean, I realize I have to somehow trigger myself that it’s been nine months.  I talk to my daughters about it all the time.  I mean, once you sit around, it’s easy to sit around and not do anything to distract yourself.  So I have to find some distractions.  So I would say taking care of myself, I can do it but it’s really hard.  But I’ve lost some of the, some of the things that I would consider pleasurable like reading and those kinds of things.  I’ve lost the patience to do them, 'cause my mind wanders.\",\n",

And I just was amazed how people --  And I’ve recently reengaged with college friends.  I didn't really tell them about this for a long time 'cause I thought I was going to be done in six months.  But I recently reengaged with them and they all came and visited.  So I would say that I’ve really, if anything, I don’t engage people enough.  If anything, I don’t call them and say for them to come over.  You know, like I had a gal stop by spontaneously this morning, which was great, and because sometimes other days they’ll call, I won’t really feel very good and I think oh, I’m not going to feel --  But it’s funny.  When someone stops by spontaneously, even if you don’t feel good it kind of perks you up just to see them.  So when people stop by spontaneously I love it.

I think after thinking that I would do chemotherapy for six months over here and then be done with it and I couldn't even really make it four months hardly, just kind of said to myself it’s going to take what it’s going to take.  I’m not happy about it but I don't know how else you can think of it, except that I don’t like the idea, you know.  I think some people are --  I know one woman that was on chemotherapy her entire life.  She took pills every day, which was what I thought I would be doing initially, that I’d get IV chemotherapy for six months and take oral every day and then I would continue the oral the rest of my life.  And I thought okay, I could do that.  So if I had to take some sort of pill every day it wouldn't bother me.  She took a pill every day.  And it looked like she handled it so much better than I’m handling it but I don't know what she was like, you know, on her own, behind her closed doors or whatever.  But I think with the help of the social worker too, kind of just saying, you know, you have cancer.  This is something – you know, it’s life-changing, like forever.  Even if you feel good, you’re always a cancer survivor and you have to learn to live with it because, you know, it can come back or --  You can’t live every day thinking oh, every little twinge is cancer, you know, 'cause it’s not going to be.  So I think seeing her every week and now every other week, I think it’s really helped me kind of more move – I’m not quite there yet, obviously, but moving more towards the chronic phase, realizing that this is not going to be over in a whim(?), that, you know, a lot of people --  Also a lot of my bearing(?) in Marin County is about breast cancer and breast cancer is very commonly spoken too over here.  Most everything you hear is about breast cancer, and breast cancer, you tend to think of it as – well it could almost be like a designer cancer to get, which you know that’s not true.  People still die of breast cancer.  It’s a very serious disease.  But early detection is the key, right, and people over here are just that way.  But it’s a tumor that you take out and then you get six months of chemotherapy and then you’re on your way, and that’s the way it’s looked at and that’s your frame of reference.  So when you don’t fit in that category, it’s hard to find what category you fit in, which is really additional to U.C. – the other benefit of going there is, you know, unfortunately for all the rest of the people in the room, but you see yourself in a – it gives you an identity because you see the entire spectrum from early diagnosis to people who are like, “Yeah, see you in a year or see you in two years” or whatever, and it makes you, when you’re sitting there waiting, you actually have a group that you identify with, versus over here it was not like that at all.  I don't know how to explain it but they just look more quaffed and more like they were on the waiting game.  And so I think that’s helped as well to move me in like, you know, I could be coming here for quite some time.\",\n",

And he was from an academic background.  He in fact had taught – he wasn't a medical doctor but he had taught some at some medical schools as an adjunct professor.  So he wanted to be seen at UCSF.  He wasn't going to take – he didn't want to be seen at the local hospital.  So that’s how I originally got introduced to the UCSF Cancer Program.  And then nine years ago, when I was originally diagnosed at the local hospital here, it became apparent very, very quickly that they just didn't know what they were – that I was an odd case.  It took them a long time to diagnose me, and in every step of the way it seemed like they were up against something they hadn't seen before.  So I said just get me out of here.  Get me to UCSF where I remembered the doctors being more interested in oddball issues rather than just wanting to process something that they knew about.\",\n",

       " \"It was two weeks after 9-11 and my stomach began to just feel awful and I couldn't eat much, I was losing weight.  So I went to my local general practitioner, who had served me well in the past for routine matters like sprains or muscle problems.  And you can imagine what it must have been like going to a doctor two weeks after 9-11 saying your stomach feels funny.  He sort of sent me home pretty quickly.  So I kept on going back and back and he was a well meaning guy but infinitely overworked.  Anyway, so I had continual stomach problems for a year until blood work finally turned up some abnormal liver problems.\",\n",
       " 'Well that kicked my general practitioner into high gear and he ordered an ultrasound and a CAT scan, which turned up all sorts of splotches in my liver, then they did a couple biopsies and they were --  Well they did one biopsy.  They were completely dumbfounded by what they found, so they did a second biopsy to get more material and they were still quite confused, and finally concluded that I had HCC, liver cancer, based mostly on the fact that one of my blood markers was high and indicative of liver cancer.  And the pathology – I guess pathology turns out to be more of an art than a science than I had thought, and so the pathologist was sort of like, “Okay, sure, it’s liver cancer.”  Anyway, it’s a long story.  It turned out not to be liver cancer.  But anyway, at that point, just from watching the process of them trying to diagnose me, I thought I don’t think these people really see people like me that often, and moving someplace where they’re used to seeing unusual cases.',\n",
       " \"So then I went to UCSF and lo and behold, they decided to do a biopsy review, give a second opinion on the --  So they got the biopsy material from Alta Bates here, they reviewed it and they concluded that I had liver cancer.  And so I sort of just tread water for a few months and then there weren't really any effective treatments for liver cancer treatments at that point.  I don't know if there are now.  But a clinical trial came along that my doctor was enthused about because it seemed to have potential, but had fairly benign side effects as opposed to the other treatments, which had horrific side effects.  So I did that for four or five months and then it didn't really seem to change the course of the disease for the better.  At that point --  Do you want me to keep talking about the history of my disease?\",\n",
       " \"So at that point I had been --  So a couple friends had suggested I go to the University of Pittsburgh because that’s a big liver center.  It’s where the first liver transplant was done, and actually a colleague at work, an older colleague, had had a liver transplant there and was pushing me to do just to get another opinion.  And I called up Pittsburgh and what was being proposed at UCSF didn't sound very exciting so I thought I have to at least see what else is out there.\",\n",
       " 'After I’d been on the trial for four or five months.',\n",
       " 'This was 2003.',\n",
       " \"So I called up Pittsburgh and they said, you know, “Clinic’s every day.  Opens at 7.  First come, first served.  You know, show up and we’ll make sure you’re seen that day.  It might take a while.”  Not very welcoming.  So I was hemming and hawing on whether to go and then miraculously, a colleague calls me up and tells me, “I hear you’re sick.  My brother’s a surgeon at the Liver Center in Pittsburgh.”  And lo and behold, the next day his brother calls me up and gives me the red carpet treatment and I’m invited out there and his brother keeps saying, “I have a suspicion this might not be liver cancer.  It might be an neuroendocrine cancer.”  So I go there and I guess I brought biopsy material and the pathology there was just, they were just confused.  They were --  This was again, it’s more of an art than a science.  But they ran a huge amount of blood work.  You know, I don't know, 60 things to test for, and a couple of them came up suspicious, like this, of it being an neuroendocrine cancer.  And they did another CT scan there and their radiologist actually found a small mass at the tip of my pancreas, which no one had seen before.  It’s hard to see, which was indicative of neuroendocrine cancers starting in the pancreas.  And so they were all ready to start with a very, some aggressive chemo embolization treatments in Pittsburgh, but I just wanted to come home and check with Dr. Vanook at UCSF.  And he was mostly convinced in the change in diagnosis but wanted to do one last test to really confirm it, a very specialized test.  So he did that test that confirmed the new diagnosis.  And he seemed to have --  The guys in Pittsburgh just, although they were great at making the diagnosis, they had one treatment that they applied to everybody, these chemo embolizations.  And Dr. Vanook said sure, we could do that but there are these other things we could do as well; are less brutal.  And so it seemed like there was --  A lot of people said, “Well so aren’t you going to go to Pittsburgh to get treated?  They came up with the right diagnosis.”  And I said, “Well no, just because they came up with the right diagnosis doesn't mean I have the right place for treatment.”  So anyway, so then I had my correct diagnosis.  Neuroendocrine cancer is typically a very slow-moving disease so I took a few deep breaths, thinking I had time to sort of think about it, but a few months later I got really sick.  I guess sort of the straw that breaks the camel’s back.  So that was in September of 2003.  Got really, really sick and it was very touch and go for a while.  And Dr. Vanook put me on streptozosine(?), which is an old, just a drug that’s used for this disease, and between that and some good luck or healing from my body, I pulled out of that.  So that takes us to early 2004.  You want me to keep going?\",\n",
       " \"Okay.  So it was pretty remarkable.  Christmas of 2003, I was down to 120 pounds, could barely look at myself in the mirror, could barely get around, and I pulled out of it and six months later I was riding my bike around town, drinking milkshakes.  And so at that point I guess lucked played its hand again.  I had a friend who was an acupuncturist who was studying – he was actually working at UCSF, trying to understand how Chinese herbs could be used against cancer and studying them at a molecular level.  Anyway, he put together this concoction that I credit with keeping me out of treatment for two years.  I was in great health for two years.  Just had to drink these disgusting herbs.  And then after two years, about the middle of 2006, it was becoming clear that their affect was not as strong as before and I ended up on a clinical trial at UCSF with Avastin, which kept me going for, well, for almost three years.  So that takes us to 2009, and then it seemed like the Avastin’s affect was fading.  And so then they put me on another clinical trial, which didn't do – well it was marginally effective, but I wasn't feeling so great in early 2010.  And actually I was feeling really, really awful and was losing weight, couldn't eat much, and it looked like sort of the end of the story.  But then we came up with this idea of putting in a J-tube, a feeding tube that goes into my intestines, and so that helped me get some nutrition.  And then I magically ended up on this other drug called Everolimus(?), which has just been proven effective in treating neuroendocrine cancers.  And so I’ve been on that drug for the last – since May of 2010.  And then so in October, 2010, I decided well, I guess I decided – I sort of pulled Dr. Vanook along into this game of liver embolizations.  I don't know if you’re familiar with the process.\",\n",
       " 'But it’s a process where they go, the interventional(?) radiologist puts a catheter into your liver and into the veins that are feeding the tumor and basically fills those veins up with micro particles that block it and thereby prevent blood flow from getting to the tumors and kill the tumors.  So it’s a little bit of an invasive procedure.  People usually feel lousy for a couple weeks.  Unfortunately I seem to have some syndrome that makes me feel really, really, really lousy for a couple weeks and then just plain old lousy for a few months.  So it takes me a while to recover from those things.  So I’ve done three embolizations, October, 2010, January of this year, May of this year, and when I saw you in the office it was my first visit with Dr. Vanook after the third embolization.',\n",

It’s too early to – you know, if I’m lucky, I’ll spring back, gain back the ten pounds I lost, and we’ll talk about a fourth one.  The interventional radiologist who performs them seems to think that they’re quite effective.\",\n",

I think they go to Phase II and lucky if they get 50 patients nationally or 100 patients nationally.  And the Avastin trial, I get the feeling they didn't pursue getting FDA approval.  I don't know why this dropped.\",\n",

You have treatments every two or three weeks and when you get treated you feel awful and then by the time you start to feel better, you get treated again.  So there’s this cycle.  And at least, you know, the last few days you’re feeling pretty good.  Every once in a while they give me an extra week off.  I feel even better.

My big problem is there’s too much tumor growth in my liver and so it’s not so much my disease; it’s management of, it’s liver management, and so we talk about that a little bit.

You know, they’re developing new drugs at a rate of, well, at a slower rate than I go through them.  So there’s one last drug that I haven't tried that may or may not work.

So somebody asks him, “Mola, what’s your secret to good judgment?”  And he says, “Experience.”  And the student says, “Oh, how do you get experience?”  And Mola says, “From bad judgment.”  And so fortunately or unfortunately, we had a number of dealings with medical issues with my father and after that it gave me a better understanding of how the medical system works.

She just wanted to say that she wouldn't be around that much and that I should understand that while I’m lying in bed with a fever of 102 and throwing up, you know, my mother might be, might die, which didn't happen.

And every time I’d go to the doctor, the doctor would just always kind of, you know, naysay, you know, “You’ve got a stressful job, you work too many hours, you need to rest more; you probably have hemorrhoids,” blah, blah, blah.  But about two years ago I started having these abdominal pains that were really bad and so I went to the doctor and the doctor set me up for gallbladder surgery, said it must be gallbladder.  And my mother had had her gallbladder removed so I said okay, I guess that makes sense.  But when I met with the gallbladder surgeon, she’s like, “Well, you know, that might be part of your symptoms but just from talking to you, I don’t think that’s everything.  And sometimes doctors are afraid to run tests because of insurance, etc., but, you know, I’m a surgeon and they get approved when surgeons request them so I’m going to go ahead and remove your gallbladder but I’m going to set up an appointment for you to have a colonoscopy when we’re done.”  And so that would've been two years ago July.  After the surgery I had the colonoscopy and that’s when I was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.  So I had definitely had it for many, many years.\",\n",

I am a Human Resource Director by profession and I’d always been in charge of the health benefits at my company and so I’d generally always been on some type of an HMO or PPO plan.  And for the year prior to me being diagnosed I had switched over to a Kaiser plan because everybody at my workplace had told me how wonderful Kaiser was and that because I had never experienced it, I felt like I needed to experience a Kaiser plan and just see what everybody talked about.  ‘Cause we were having a really hard time with renewal rates and keeping Kaiser in as one of our options.  So here I find myself, for the first time in my life, on Kaiser with actually no other options other than Kaiser as far as treatment if I want coverage, and it just so happened that it was the open enrollment period for insurance.  So I immediately switched over to a PPO plan and flew to Cleveland, Ohio, to the Cleveland Clinic, where my brother-in-law is on staff as a pediatrician, and he was able to get me in to see one of the top colon cancer oncologist in the United States.  And he was getting ready to go on vacation so it was like, “If you can get here next Tuesday, I can do surgery on you, 'cause I leave on vacation on Friday.”  And so we just caught a plane and went to Cleveland and had surgery.  So he removed about 12 inches of colon and as he had me on the operating table, was able to see that it had metastasized into the liver and then X-rays of course showed it was in the lungs.  And so they set me up to meet with the liver guy at Cleveland and, you know, he was fairly optimistic.  He was definitely very confident in his skills and his abilities and said, “You know, what you want to do is recover from surgery, go through a couple bouts of chemo and then we can do surgery.”  And he referred me to Dr. Vanook(?) at UCSF when I returned, so I met with Dr. Vanook when I got back and he put me on chemo and we’ve been going through that for the last two years.\",\n",

       " 'Yes.',\n",
       " 'Well I don’t.  I guess because my doctor at Kaiser had immediately set me up for surgery and what had kind of made me really nervous is that he had set me up for surgery with a thoracic surgeon and that made me really uneasy that they were going to have a thoracic surgeon operate on my colon.  Now it was found a week later that that was an error and they had corrected it and set me up with a doctor that specialized in colon and they had switched it.  But it was just like, “That’s what we do if you have colon cancer.  We operate.”',\n",
       " 'Yeah.',\n",
       " \"Because of my brother’s recommendation.  To get into Kaiser was going to take a month and it seemed like that’s what Kaiser was saying, I was going to need surgery to go in and remove the cancer from the colon.  I mean, what they had said, “If you’re ever going to have cancer, colon cancer’s the kind to have 'cause it can be removed.  You go in, you cut it out, sew it up and, you know, as long as you catch it in time and it hasn't metastasized, it’s done and over with.”  And I guess that was explained to me by the doctor who had done my colonoscopy, though I was still, you know, heavily medicated from having done the anesthesia from the colonoscopy.  And when I talked to my brother-in-law, who is a physician, we had sent my records from Kaiser to Cleveland so they had looked at them and said yes, it’s operable and that’s what we should do.  What was the specific question?\",\n",
       " 'You know, the Cleveland Clinic is high on those hospitals and so when you have somebody from that facility telling you what to do, I tend to take their word for it, having no medical background in my family.  It’s kind of like all right, I guess they know what they’re talking about.  Let’s do it.',\n",

       " \"No, it wasn't long at all.\",\n",
       " \"The only other option that we were looking at was the Kaiser option, because I knew that if I didn't take the fast track at the Cleveland Clinic because of my connections with my brother-in-law, I knew it was going to mean, okay, I could change insurance in San Francisco but first of all, I’m going to have to find an oncologist and then he’s going to have to refer me to a specialist that’s going to specialize in the colon.  Then I’m going to have to get another appointment, and I knew that it could be several months before I could get into surgery or I felt that it could take months before I’d get into surgery.  Where if I went to Cleveland, you know, my brother-in-law had been there for years, he was head of the Pediatric division, he had connections and I knew that he could push me through quickly.  And so I really didn't look at other options at that point.\",\n",
       " \"We talked a little bit about me staying in Cleveland but if it had been my side of the family, I think I would've probably considered it more heavily, but it was my husband’s side of the family and we just kind of decided that I didn't really want to stay out there by myself, that I could get the support of my spouse, and I had a job in San Francisco that I liked.  And so it was mostly just out of well that’s where I live and they’ve got very good doctors in San Francisco.  It’s not like I was living somewhere where I felt the medical attention would be subpar.  I felt that I could get good coverage or good treatment in San Francisco.\",\n",

And those are the kinds of decisions that you kind of look at quality of life and, you know, which best fits my life.  So right now we’re doing two weeks on, one week off.  So I go in – right now it’s on Wednesdays and I go in to San Francisco and do blood work.  And then about an hour, hour and a half later, I go into the Infusion Center and do chemotherapy infusion for about three hours.  And that’s really all there is now with the treatment.  My previous treatment was much more complicated and time consuming.  So this one I go in on Wednesdays, spend like noon to five or six, and my husband drives me home and that’s pretty much it as far as treatments.  And I do it for two Wednesdays in a row, then I have a Wednesday off.',\n",
       " \"It’s going fine.  I’m having different reactions to this chemo than I had from the previous one.  The previous one I’d been on for two years and the doctor had said, you know, most of his patients, two to three months is all they can handle of that particular chemo, and I handled it for two years.  This one was supposed to be much easier and his patients were on it forever and they don’t lose their hair, and I lost my hair within three weeks.  He said he’d only had one other patient that had ever lost their hair on this treatment.  And as far as side effects, it’s really just been the loss of my hair and being tired and fatigued, very, very mild nausea, some constipation, which is normal.  I have to monitor that.  And I haven't had a CT scan yet.  We’ll go probably two more rounds of chemo before we do a CT scan to see whether or not it’s had any affect or not.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe, if I can think of them.  I am on Arinatecan(?) now.  The doctor refers to it as the Martha Stewart drug.  It’s the one that Martha Stewart went to jail for insider trading.  It’s a drug that patients who have Gilbert’s syndrome sometimes have a reaction to it.  I happen to be one of those patients that has Gilbert’s.  So a lot of patients will go into toxic shock, they can get cholera, so they’re monitoring me pretty closely, only giving me like an 85% dosage right now, just to see how I can handle it.  And that’s why I didn't go on it initially, though it’s the one the doctor preferred to put patients on first.  Prior to that, in the last – I was on Oxaliplatin and – it was called Fullfox(?).  It’s Oxaliplatin and something.  It’s a cocktail that they call Fullfox.  And that was one that I would be at the Infusion Center for about eight hours and then I would actually go home connected to a bottle of chemo for two days or 48 hours and then go back and have it, take it out.\",\n",
       " \"No.  I think, if anything, as far as a surprise, it’s been how normal I still kind of feel.  I knew no one who had --  Well I did know someone who had been through chemo but I had not really talked to them in detail about it, so I really hadn't been around anybody or seen it.  I didn't know what to expect the first time I went in.  So I was, I think, pleasantly surprised to find out that it’s, I don't know, it wasn't as life-altering as I thought it was going to be initially.  After two years, I do find now that I’m much more tired and because I’m Stage IV, it’s not like we’re looking for a cure.  It’s, you know – yeah, there could always be a miracle drug that does come out and, you know, and I’m curable.  Right now I’m just looking for length of life.  And so it’s not like oh, if I go through, you know, six rounds of this, I can stop.  It’s like no, this is what I’m going to be doing for the rest of my life so it’s trying to find – you know, how can I continue to be as normal as possible?  The last four months I finally found myself really getting tired but up until then, I had still been working full time and still going on trips and still playing golf and still feeling pretty normal.\",\n",

I didn't want to be housebound, I didn't want to be --  You know, I think if it ever gets to that point, then there’ll be a “let’s think about should we continue treatment”, because most of my side effects, or I guess most of the negative reactions I’m having right now is due to the treatment, not the illness.  And so once you get to the point where you feel like the treatment isn’t more valuable than the illness, then you kind of quit the treatment.  And I didn't really understand that when the doctor told me that two years ago, you know.  I just kind of said, “Well no, you just keep having treatment until the end, you know, you keep fighting it with treatment.”  But I can kind of see now, you know, as you’ve gone through it for a couple of years and how your body starts to react and how you feel and the tiredness and it’s not, I could see where it’s not necessarily giving up.  There just will come a point down the road that it will be that the treatment does not outweigh the benefit of treatment.\",\n",

And so when the doctor said, “Well let’s try a different type of chemo and see if you feel better, give that a try” --  And I bought the books to read but they’re still sitting in the cellophane wrap -- [Chuckles] -- you know, that people have referred to me to look at different types of homeopathic types of treatments.',\n",

       " \"I just kind of remember us both kind of feeling like, you know, we’re kind of doing this with blind trust but we, you know, highly respect Gary’s brother and so oftentimes we do make medical decisions based on his brother’s recommendation, though his brother is definitely a conservative doctor.  And we just kind of said to each other that we both felt like it was the mainstream treatment and, you know, we have, in the last two years, met a lot of people that feel like their positive results have been from the chemotherapy that they’ve been on.  So we both just kind of agreed that until I couldn't tolerate it anymore, we should just continue it.\",\n",
       " 'I don’t.  I know that --  It might have been that we were planning a trip or we were looking at going to Tahoe to do some golf.  And I was like, you know, “Oh, I might be able to do one day,” where normally it’s like, “Oh, yeah, let’s go play golf every day,” and I was just very hesitant.  And Gary was like, “Why are you so hesitant?”  And it’s like well I kind of was at the end of my patience at that point and I was like, “Well because I’m sick.”  And he’s always been very supportive but he’s a very calm guy.  He’s like, “Well what do you mean you’re sick?”  That I think is kind of just how that whole conversation started, letting(?) out(?) my frustrations.',\n",

       " \"My family, my parents and my sister and her husband, come from very strong, Evangelical Christian roots.  And so conversations with them are always about healing and faith and prayer.  And even Dr. Vanook is very supportive of, you know, that positive mind set, that you’ve got to believe that this is worth doing, you know.  That’s part of the healing process, is that positive, you know, I want to get up in the morning, I want to get better, I want to move forward.  And so having their support has always been good, but their support is always kind of around the, I don't know, the miracle.  And it’s like praying for the miracle.  And I, while I’m a firm believer in positive belief, still feel like, you know, God has given us a brain to use it and to move forward with treatments and ways that he has provided for us in order to get better.  So that side of the family conversations I really kind of try to keep to a minimum because it’s just always kind of a very heavy, you know, conversation that gets into a lot of theology and theory.  I had a friend, a golfing buddy, who had colon cancer the year before I did and we were still playing golf while she was going through her chemotherapy and I didn't even realize what she was going through.  But once I was diagnosed she shared a lot of the details with me.  And so I think that was always kind of supportive.  I mean, hers was – I can’t remember – I think Stage II, so it was going through a certain number of chemo treatments and then stopping and she’s doing much better now.  But at least she understood what it was like going through the procedures.  And I guess just from seeing that it did help her and, you know, we would have conversations on the golf course in between holes, you know, about what’s this like, you know, and she was always, “Oh, you’re going to meet some of the greatest people you’ll ever know in your life and, you know, you can do this,” and so she was always very supportive.  I can’t think of really anybody else.  Even my brother-in-law, the doctor, I know my husband had conversations with him but he’s never been one to say that he knows anything about anything other than pediatrics, you know.  You call him and say, “I’ve got an earache.”  He’s like, “Well you know, I treat children, not adults.  But probably if you do this, this and this, it’ll probably work.”  So he’s never really been pushy but he definitely believes in the team that he works with at the hospital.\",\n",
       " \"Well just that – maybe mainstream is a better – just that he’s, you know, he’s not into a lot of the homeopathic or the different --  So, you know, I say that.  He actually did a clinical study with a product which is now very well known, Coldies(?), but at the time it wasn't, but it was kind of unusual and, you know, he did that with the children.  But I’ve always kind of --  I never felt like he would send me to some hospital in Switzerland to try something new.  It would be, you know, U.S. medicine, you know, the main hospitals.\",\n",
       " 'Yes.',\n",
       " \"Well I guess we’ve had conversations about things like what’s it like to lose your hair and what do people say to you and, you know, what do you say back when people, you know, make comments.  She’s just been someone who’s --  She’s always kind of a bit of a Debbie Downer, so people kind of tease me about, “Oh, you’re hanging out with Chris again?”, you know.  But yet I don’t really find her to be that negative.  She’s just kind of a realist, this is what it is and, you know, she just doesn't sugar-coat it.  So I feel like if I pretty much asked her anything, from driving – I would ask her, “Do you drive yourself to and from infusions?” to, you know, “What do you do while you’re at the Infusion Center?  What do you do for the nurses at the Infusion Center?  Are you able to shower?”  I was asking her about, you know, “How do you get in and out of the shower when you’ve got the chemo pump hooked up?”  So it was more just kind of the how-tos.  She would talk to me a little bit more about her husband, 'cause her husband’s reaction was much tougher than my husband’s.  He has a really hard time with it, 'cause she did have cancer about 15 years ago and, you know, having a relapse he’s very concerned and fearful.  So we talk a little bit about the husbands and their reactions and support.\",\n",

Because I’m going to San Francisco, I never – I’m not a morning person.  But just kind of that sort of things.  “How do you say thank you to” –  I know it’s their job, you know, they get paid for it and you don’t have to do anything, but I just feel like they make that process much, much more tolerable and enjoyable than they’re required to do.  They’re just, I think, a phenomenal team.',\n",
       " \"They remember my name.  You know, when I walk in the door it’s, you know, “Hi, Carla.  I haven't seen you in a while,” or “how you doing?”  You know, they remember things.  Like they ask about my cats.  When I was adopting the kittens, you know, and having to decide, they remember those kinds of stories.  And I generally will see a different nurse every week, and my husband is just blown away with the kinds of things that they remember when they hadn't seen me in four or five months and they still remember certain personal details.  Yeah, 'cause sometimes it’s medical details but more often than not, it’s the personal details, it’s knowing about your personal life and how are you doing, you know, “How you doing with the cats?”, you know.  And it’s kind of like, you know, “Are you hanging in there?  Are you being positive?”  My nurse practitioner with the oncologist, he just goes out of his way with --  We communicate mostly by email during the week, but I never feel like I’m interrupting him with a weird email.  Last week I was having a really weird colored bowel movement and I felt like oh, it’s no big deal.  I can just ask Tom.  I’ll just shoot him an email and he won’t be offended.  Where I feel – like other --  My husband’s side of the family are all doctors and so I hear their comments.  You know, one’s a surgeon and he’s like, you know, “When they call me in the middle of the night and wake me up, I have to make sure that I put them through, you know, the hoops that they have to jump through so that next time before they call and wake me up, they’re going to think about should they be calling me and waking me up,” you know.  I hear that side of --  And I know it’s different.  You know, surgeons are surgeons.  But Tom just never makes me feel like I’m interrupting him, and not that I call him in the middle of the night either, but that it’s always, “Hey, that’s no big deal; don’t worry about it,” or, “Oh, let’s get you in and let’s try this medicine or let’s try something different.”  They just all really make me feel like I’m important, that I’m not just another patient, that, you know, they want to see me get better.  They like it when you get better.  They want you to succeed.\",\n",
       " \"Well with Dr. Vanook, you know, from the very first time I met him, he gave me the, I don't know, the --  Shoot, what am I trying to say?  The, “And by the way, if you’re looking for a doctor that you’re going to see regularly and have conversations with regularly and really be on a one-on-one basis with you, I’m not the right doctor for you.”  He goes, “And we’ve got other doctors in the practice that are really great that I’ll refer you to.  It’s not a problem.”  You know, he made it very clear from the get-go that he’s involved in a lot of research, a lot of education and he’s only in the office one day a week and that, you know, “The one-on-one time with me would be minimal,” but said, “You’ll have lots of interactions with Tom and Tom keeps me on top of all the information, what’s going on, and so before Tom will make decisions, he’ll run them by me so I will know what’s going on with you.”  And I will say that’s been exactly the way it’s been.  I see Dr. Vanook every four to six months and I see Tom every time I go in for chemo.  He makes it a point to come down and see me in the Infusion Center, come up to see me in the Infusion Center.  I feel like he does know what’s going on with me.  He sees how I’m doing on an ongoing basis.  I feel like he’s on top with treatments.  You know, he gives me feedback or answers my questions.  He remembers things that happened six months ago, a year ago, and will do whatever it takes to try to make me comfortable.  I don’t think either one of them were really quite aware of --  Nobody will give you numbers.  Nobody will say, “Oh, you’ve got six months to live, two years to live, ten years to live,” 'cause nobody knows.  And everybody responds differently to it.  So when I was diagnosed and we were pushing, you know, “Well how long do we have to live, how long do we have to live?” and it’s like, “Well, you know, the average is” – I think at that point it was 18 months and they now say it’s 20 months, and so you kind of have that timeline in mind that okay, you know, what on my bucket list do I have to do in the next 20 months?  And you know, my treatment, which is much different and my body reaction, so here I am now two years later and still right about where I was two years ago, so I could still have another two years or I could still have another ten years.  You don’t really know.  But it was just recently, at my last appointment, the one that you were at, then I, I think I had a conversation with Tom about, you know, “Tom, so how much more time do you think I have?”  And he kind of looked at me and he said, “You know, I have patients who have tumors the size of cantaloupes.  You know, those are the ones that I can give timelines to, you know.  You, yours are six centimeters” or whatever they are.  “If they stay at this growth, this rate of growth, you know, you still have a lot of time left.”  And until I heard that, I don’t think I really realized that I could have time left, and that’s when I really needed to start thinking about quality of time.  ‘Cause okay, I could have ten years of low quality or two years of high quality or medium quality.  There’s a decision you have to make at one point about the quality of life.  But I don’t think either one of them really understood where my head was around how long I had to live, but I don't know that any does.  I mean, they don’t know, I don't know.  It’s just kind of you take it one appointment at a time, one CAT scan at a time and see what happens.  And I was trying to plan vacations for the rest of the year and didn't even know if I should plan vacations for October.  And Tom’s like, “Well yeah, you can plan a vacation for October.  You’re going to be around.”  You know, the tiredness that I have is from the chemo; it’s not from the tumor, so you could cut the chemo, if we wanted, for the month.\",\n",
       " \"I think it was inadvertent.  I don’t think he realized that he was actually --  I don't know, the way he worded it, just made me kind of get an ah-ha.  It’s like oh, he doesn't know so it’s not like he’s withholding information, but at least he’s now giving me a comparative analogy, that I can see why he can’t give me a number.  And oh, okay.  So yeah.\",\n",
       " \"No, I still feel like my relationship with Tom is, you know, is growing and developing and, you know, is a very positive manner(?).  And it’s not that I don’t have high expectations for Dr. Vanook.  I mean, I think because of his role and who he is, I have really high expectations of Dr. Vanook with his research, you know.  I want him to get out there and find a cure for the disease.  But what I’m getting from him as far as an appointment every four to six months, is really kind of what I expected.  He tends to give you the worst case scenario, which, you know, doctors have to do, and he tries to lighten it up with some humor and we call him the Colombo of the surgeons 'cause he’s just kind of this funny old man.  He’s not old.  I don’t mean it that way.  But just, he’s just kind of --  But you know there’s a brain there that’s just phenomenal, the things that he comes up with, and he’s got this wit of Colombo that you just kind of snicker at.

And then I’ve sat in chairs next to other patients that have been considering not doing the chemo thing.  Some people are very open about their opinions and some people are very quiet about their opinions.  So it’s just kind of been listening at this point, kind of being more, I don't know --  Sorry I have chemo brain.  I haven't really done a lot of aggressive research.\",\n",

But it’s always interesting to hear things that people have heard or researched and then I go back and will do some research as well.  I don’t really take what they say as gospel.

Because, you know, people kind of assume, well I must just be sitting at home on the Internet and be Googling it constantly.  And I think sometimes – yes, there’s always the fear of the unknown, you know.  Am I better off not knowing than knowing?  You know, is it easier for me to stay positive?  But I just also find that so often some of the things that you find on the Internet, you know, are so inaccurate.  If it’s a basic symptom or --  You know, my doctor gave me a prescription yesterday that didn't make any sense to me and I go well I can either call the doctor and ask her why in the world she gave me this prescription -- you know, after picking it up at the pharmacy and the notes that got attached to it didn't make any sense to me -- or I can just go Google it.  And I Googled it.  It’s like oh, I can see it’s also used for these things and these things.  So in that case, you know, the Internet’s helpful.  But I think sometimes when you’re going into alternative medicines or alternative treatments, sometimes the Internet isn’t the best place to go to get accurate information.  So anyway, I fear finding out inaccurate information.  And then so much like the Suzanne Somers’ things are intriguing and interesting, you know, but then you start reading, you know, “Oh, the whole chemotherapy is a complete scam and it’s the way that drug companies are making money but it really doesn't have any influence on it,” so then it’s like that kind of makes you negative.  It’s like well I don’t want to give up hope.  I mean, if I’m going I and doing this every week, I want to feel like it’s helping.  So anyway, I guess it’s kind of a roundabout way of saying, you know, I don’t want negative information and negative vibes, but then sometimes I’ll have people say, “Well have you researched that cancer clinic in X, Y, Z city?”  And it’s like, “Well no.”  And they’re like, “Well shouldn't you?  I mean, shouldn't you be looking at all your options?  Shouldn't you be trying everything?”  And my aunt had died of cancer when I was a small child and my uncle had taken her to all these clinics in Europe and different places.

So I think I’m kind of a realist and it’s like well, it kind of probably all balances out and at this point I don’t feel like I’m at a, you know, a timeline where I don’t have other options.

That was not the case at California Pacific.  The other is in terms of, you know, an outpatient procedure, which was bile stint replacement.  The protocol for the stint placement and care after the stint placement seemed to be a higher level of care at UCSF and could've actually, I believe, if that level of care or protocol were followed in the first bile stint replacement, could have possibly – I’m not a medical professional so I don't know and one can never predict outcomes – but could have possibly prevented the infection and first hospitalization and subsequent hospitalization.\",\n",

So, you know, at that point I may have some questions for Dr. Coe as far as, you know, whether there are any surprises that I might expect when it’s in remission and what I should look out for in terms of potential returning of the cancer or anything like that.

It’s really hard to pinpoint if you asked me, “Well how did it affect your choice of treatment?”  You know, it’s difficult to pinpoint but having faith and believing in…in that suffering or this illness is not something that cannot be overcome, I think that, you know, the spiritual practice has allowed me to live that path, which has then affected my choices about being very mindful of my nutrition practices, believing that acupuncture helps and that guided imagery helps and that the chemotherapy helps.  All of that I think is intangibly affected by my spiritual practices.',\n",

It’s a relatively rare cancer; 3,000 people a year in the U.S. are diagnosed with this form of cancer.  So it’s not like there’s a lot out there about it.  But that was a good source of information for me.  You know, I’ve found various things on, you know, the American Cancer Society website, information at National Institute for Health, things like that, about the disease.  I must say that I didn't find too much that was optimistic about it, and so, you know, it – yeah, I didn't find too much that was optimistic about, you know, the cancer, this form of cancer going into remission, other than recently having read a couple of case studies on that and, anecdotally, people telling me that, you know, some people with this cancer survive many years or are doing very well, without my asking what were the specifics of the cancer.\",\n",
